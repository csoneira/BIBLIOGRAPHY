2000_article_a_new_high_resolution_tof_technology,"In the framework of the ALICE collaboration we have recently studied the performance of multigap Resistive Plate Chambers operated in avalanche mode and at atmospheric pressure for time-of-#ight measurements. The detector provided an overall (detector plus electronics) timing accuracy of 120 ps sigma at an e$ciency of 98% for MIPs. The chambers had four gas gaps of 0.3 mm, each limited by a metallised ceramic plate and a glass plate, with an active dimension of 4]4 cm2. The gas mixture contained C H F #5% isobutane#10% SF . A few percent of streamer 2 2 4 6 discharges, each releasing about 20 pC, was tolerated without any noticeable inconvenience. This detector opens perspectives of a!ordable and reliable high granularity large area TOF detectors, with an e$ciency and a time resolution comparable to existing scintillator-based TOF technology but with signi""cantly, up to an order of magnitude, lower price per channel.

2000_article_coronal_mass_ejections_and_forbush_decreases,". Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are plasma eruptions from the solar atmosphere involving previously closed field regions which are expelled into the interplanetary medium. Such regions, and the shocks which they may generate, have pronounced effects on cosmic ray densities both locally and at some distance away. These energetic particle effects can often be used to identify CMEs in the interplanetary medium, where they are usually called ‘ejecta’. When both the ejecta and shock effects are present the resulting cosmic ray event is called a ‘classical, two-step’ Forbush decrease. This paper will summarize the characteristics of CMEs, their effects on particles and the present understanding of the mechanisms involved which cause the particle effects. The role of CMEs in long term modulation will also be discussed."

2000_article_muon_observations,". Muon observations are complementary to neutron monitor observations but there are some important differences in the two techniques. Unlike neutron monitors, muon telescope systems use coincidence techniques to obtain directional information about the arriving particle. Neutron monitor observations require simple corrections for pressure variations to compensate for the varying mass of atmospheric absorber over a site. In contrast, muon observations require additional corrections for the positive and negative temperature effects. Muon observations commenced many years before neutron monitors were constructed. Thus, muon data over a larger number of solar cycles is available to study solar modulation on anisotropies and other cosmic ray variations. The solar diurnal and semi-diurnal variations have been studied for many years. Using the tech- niques of Bieber and Chen it has been possible to derive the radial gradient, parallel mean-free path and symmetric latitude gradient of cosmic rays for rigidities <200 GV. The radial gradient varies with the 11-year solar activity cycle whereas the parallel mean-free path appears to vary with the 22- year solar magnetic cycle. The symmetric latitudinal gradient reverses at each solar polarity reversal. These results are in general agreement with predictions from modulation models. In undertaking these analyses the ratio of the parallel to perpendicular mean-free path must be assumed. There is strong contention in the literature about the correct value to employ but the results are sufficiently robust for this to be, at most, a minor problem. An asymmetric latitude gradient of highly variable nature has been found. These observations do not support current modulation models. Our view of the sidereal variation has undergone a revolution in recent times. Nagashima, Fuji- moto and Jacklyn proposed a narrow Tail-In source anisotropy and separate Loss-Cone anisotropy as being responsible for the observed variations. A new analysis technique, more amenable to such structures, was developed by Japanese and Australian researchers. They confirmed the existence of the two anisotropies. However, they found that the Tail-In anisotropy is asymmetric and that both anisotropies had different positions from the prediction. Most 27-day modulations are observed at neutron monitor rigidities but not so readily at higher rigidities. An exception to this is the Isotropic Intensity Wave modulation observed in the early 1980s and again in 1991. This modulation is very strongly related to the heliospheric sector structure and implies a significantly different cosmic ray density on either side of the neutral sheet. The interpretation of most cosmic ray modulation phenomena requires good latitude coverage in both hemispheres. The closure of many muon observatories is a matter of concern. In the northern hemisphere a few new instruments are being constructed and spatial coverage is barely adequate. In the southern hemisphere the situation is far worse with the possibility that within a decade only the Mawson observatory in Antarctica will still be in operation."

2001_article_j_phys_g_nucl_phys_10_1984_1609_1628_printed_in_great_britai,". The differential and integral spectra of muons moving in the near-vertical direction have been measured at Nottingham using a solid iron magnet spectrometer. This instrument utilised an automatic recording system for data collection which allowed the range of muon momenta covered by this investigation to extend from 4 to 3000 GeV/c. the lower limit being set by the magnet itself. The diffusion model for particle propagation through the Earth’s atmosphere was used to provide the muon momentum spectrum incident upon the instrument. A comparison of this spectrum, after modification by scattering and errors in the determination of the angular deflection, with the measured spectrum allowed a value of -2.72 i 0.0 1 to be assigned to the exponent of the primary spectrum. If a contribution to the sea-level muon flux from the decay of K mesons is included then better agreement between the theoretical and experimental spectra is obtained for a value of the exponent of -2.73 together with a K/n ratio at production of 0.087. However, when the muon momentum range is reduced to 28-3000 GeV/c the comparison between the measured and the theoretical spectra shows agreement for an exponent of -2.60 + 0.01 for 100% n-meson parentage. Further, the inclusion of K-meson decay in this case is inconclusive since it does not allow any sensible values to be assigned to the exponent or the contribution provided by this process."

2003_article_measurement_of_the_east_west_asymmetry_of_the_cosmic_muon_fl,The east–west asymmetry of the cosmic muon flux has been measured in Hanoi where the geomagnetic rigidity cut-off reaches its maximal value of 17 GV. The measurement was made using an orientable scintillator telescope that had been previously used to measure the zenith angle distribution of the cosmic muon flux in the direction of the geographic north. The data exhibit a clear east–west asymmetry in good agreement with the predictions of a model widely used in the analysis of atmospheric neutrino oscillation studies.  2003 Elsevier B.V.

The measurement is of interest for the understanding of the development of cosmic ray showers in the earth atmosphere. The dependence of the cosmic muon flux (integrated over charges and momenta) on zenith angle θ is measured to be of the approximate form (Φ0 − a sin2 θ) × cos2 θ with Φ0 = 72.0 ± 1.6 m−2 sr−1 s−1 and a = 7.8 ± 0.8 m−2 sr−1 s−1 .

2004_article_cosmic_ray_muon_observation_at_southern_space_observatory_x2,". Under an agreement on scientific cooperation between Brazil and Japan, a prototype detector of cosmic ray muons has been operating since March 2001 at Southern Space Observatory (SSO) located at São Martinho da Serra (29◦ S, 53◦ W), Brazil, in order to observe cosmic ray precursors of geomagnetic storms. This detector plays a key roll in the prototype network of muon observations together with two larger detectors operating in Japan and Australia. The planned extension of the detector in its size will complete the global coverage of our muon detector network. The prototype network has already discovered cosmic ray precursors of several magnetic storms, as reported by Munakata et al. (Munakata, K. et al.: 2000, J Geophys Res. 105, A12, pp. 27, 457–27, 468; Munakata K. et al.: 2001, Proceedings of ICRC.) We have also observed the Forbush Decreases (FDs), as well as the precursory enhancements of cosmic ray anisotropy preceding the onsets of geomagnetic storms. This report presents the description of the network and some results obtained since the prototype detector implementation."
2004_article_forbush_decreases_in_the_cosmic_radiation,". The experimental observations of Forbush decreases in recent years are reviewed and related to different theoretical models which have been proposed. The observational data from both ground-based and spacecraft experiments were selected to illustrate the important charac- teristics of Forbush decreases. The form of the rigidity dependence of the cosmic-ray modulation during the decreases and effects of the geomagnetic field upon the magnitude of the decreases are discussed. Recent results to deduce the cosmic-ray flow patterns from the observed anisotropies during the decreases are presented. Other features such as differences in onset times, recovery times, precursory increases are discussed. In considering the theoretical models particular emphasis is placed upon the agreement of the predictions of the model with the experimental observations. A theoretical model is suggested which is not original but represents a synthesis of several models previously proposed. Future important measurements and analyses necessary to an understanding of Forbush decreases are outlined."

2005_article_a_large_area_muon_tracking_detector_for_ultra_high_energy_co,"Certain aspects of ultra-high energy (UHE) cosmic ray astrophysics require correlated studies on the electron and muon components of air showers, namely, the search for cosmic ray sources through g-ray astronomy and studies on the variation of the nuclear composition of primary cosmic rays with energy. While studies on the electron component provide basic information about the arrival direction and energy, it is the muon component that plays a crucial role in distinguishing primary g-rays from charged cosmic ray particles and in determining the composition. A large area (560 m2 ), tracking muon detector of the GRAPES-3 experiment, operating at Ooty in southern India, has been designed for detailed studies on both of these aspects of UHE cosmic ray astrophysics. We present here the details of the muon detector, associated electronics and the data acquisition system.

Using sixth degreesimulationsof the quiescentgeomagneticfield, we have stud- ied the vertical cutoff rigidities of more than three hundredpositionson the earth's surface. Twenty-six of these positionsare near the South African magnetic anomaly, and six other points are in a region of the North Atlantic where Pomerantz and Agarwal have reported anomalousresults. The cutoff rigidities have been obtained by detailed computation of the trajectoriesof cosmicraysat 0.01-byrigidity intervalsto allow for the effectsof the penumbra. Differencesgreater than 15% from the Quenby and Wenk threshold values have been found in the vicinity of South Africa, the South Atlantic, and the Canary Islands.Various latitude surveys are shown to exhibit consistencywhen plotted against the cutoff rigidities determined by this computationalmethod. It is concludedthat, though there is essentiallyno difference between the cutoff rigidities obtained using two currently acceptedfield models,these simula- tions of the geomagneticfield are not completely adequate over some parts of the earth to describe the cosmic-rayeffects in their entirety.

2010_article_confidential_not_for_distribution_submitted_to_the_american,"We analyze the precursor of a Forbush Decrease (FD) observed with the Global Muon Detector Network on December 14, 2006. An intense geomagnetic storm is also recorded during this FD with the peak Kp index of 8+. By using the “two-dimensional map” of the cosmic ray intensity produced after removing the contribution from the diurnal anisotropy, we succeed in extracting clear sig- natures of the precursor. A striking feature of this event is that a weak loss-cone signature is first recorded more than a day prior to the Storm Sudden Com- mencement (SSC) onset. This suggests that the loss-cone precursor appeared only 7 hours after the Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) eruption from the Sun, when the Interplanetary (IP) shock driven by the Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection (ICME) was located at 0.4 AU from the Sun. We find the precursor being successively observed with multiple detectors in the network according to the Earth’s spin and confirmed that the precursor continuously exists in space. The long lead time (15.6 hours) of this precursor which is almost twice the typical value indicates that the IMF was more quiet in this event than a typical power spectrum assumed for the IMF turbulence. The amplitude (-6.45 %) of the loss- cone anisotropy at the SSC onset is more than twice the FD size, indicating that the maximum intensity depression behind the IP shock is much larger than the FD size recorded at the Earth in this event. We also find the excess intensity from the sunward IMF direction clearly observed during ∼10 hours preceding the SSC onset. It is shown that this excess intensity is consistent with the measurement of the particles accelerated by the head-on collisions with the approaching shock. This is the first detailed observation of the precursor due to the shock reflected particles with muon detectors. –3–"

The setup consists of two long scintillator counters with double-ended readout. Previous measurements have shown that the intensity of muons obey the cos 2 0 distribution. In this thesis, two methods are used. The first method is by rotating the whole setup to point at the zenith angle un- der measurement. The second method is by time of flight measurement. With the double-ended readout, the position of the muon pass through can be reconstructed from the time difference between the two ends. Therefore, the paths of muons can be 2 also reconstructed. Both measurements confirmed the cos 0 distribution, with 'tails' at large zenith angles, which is also found in previous measurements."

2011_article_median_filtering_algorithms_for_multichannel_detectors,"Particle detectors of worldwide networks are continuously measuring various secondary particle ﬂuxes incident on Earth surface. At the Aragats Space Environmental Center (ASEC), the data of 12 cosmic ray particle detectors with a total of 280 measuring channels (count rates of electrons, muons and neutrons channels) are sent each minute via wireless bridges to a MySQL database. These time series are used for the diﬀerent tasks of oﬀ-line physical analysis and for online forewarning services. Usually long time series contain several types of errors (gaps due to failures of high or low voltage power supply, spurious spikes due to radio interferences, abrupt changes of mean values of several channels or/and slowly trends in mean values due to aging of electronics components, etc.). To avoid erroneous physical inference and false alarms of alerting systems we introduce oﬄine and online ﬁlters to “purify” multiple time-series. In the pre- sented paper we classify possible mistakes in time series and introduce median ﬁltering algorithms for online and oﬀ-line “puriﬁcation” of multiple time-series. Ó 2011 COSPAR.

2012_article_eur_phys_j_h_37_359_412_2012,". The discovery of extensive air showers by Rossi, Schmeiser, Bothe, Kohlhörster and Auger at the end of the 1930s, facilitated by the coincidence technique of Bothe and Rossi, led to fundamental con- tributions in the ﬁeld of cosmic ray physics and laid the foundation for high-energy particle physics. Soon after World War II a cosmic ray group at MIT in the USA pioneered detailed investigations of air shower phenomena and their experimental skill laid the foundation for many of the methods and much of the instrumentation used today. Soon in- terests focussed on the highest energies requiring much larger detectors to be operated. The ﬁrst detection of air ﬂuorescence light by Japanese and US groups in the early 1970s marked an important experimental breakthrough towards this end as it allowed huge volumes of atmo- sphere to be monitored by optical telescopes. Radio observations of air showers, pioneered in the 1960s, are presently experiencing a renais- sance and may revolutionise the ﬁeld again. In the last 7 decades the research has seen many ups but also a few downs. However, the exam- ple of the Cygnus X-3 story demonstrated that even non-conﬁrmable observations can have a huge impact by boosting new instrumentation to make discoveries and shape an entire scientiﬁc community."

2012_article_living_rev_solar_phys_9_2012_3_living_re_vie_ws,"Solar eruptive phenomena embrace a variety of eruptions, including flares, solar energetic particles, and radio bursts. Since the vast majority of these are associated with the eruption, development, and evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), we focus on CME observations in this review. CMEs are a key aspect of coronal and interplanetary dynamics. They inject large quantities of mass and magnetic flux into the heliosphere, causing major transient dis- turbances. CMEs can drive interplanetary shocks, a key source of solar energetic particles and are known to be the major contributor to severe space weather at the Earth. Studies over the past decade using the data sets from (among others) the SOHO, TRACE, Wind, ACE, STEREO, and SDO spacecraft, along with ground-based instruments, have improved our knowledge of the origins and development of CMEs at the Sun and how they contribute to space weather at Earth. SOHO, launched in 1995, has provided us with almost continuous coverage of the solar corona over more than a complete solar cycle, and the heliospheric im- agers SMEI (2003 – 2011) and the HIs (operating since early 2007) have provided us with the capability to image and track CMEs continually across the inner heliosphere. We review some key coronal properties of CMEs, their source regions and their propagation through the solar wind. The LASCO coronagraphs routinely observe CMEs launched along the Sun-Earth line as halo-like brightenings. STEREO also permits observing Earth-directed CMEs from three different viewpoints of increasing azimuthal separation, thereby enabling the estimation of their three-dimensional properties. These are important not only for space weather prediction purposes, but also for understanding the development and internal structure of CMEs since we view their source regions on the solar disk and can measure their in-situ characteristics along their axes. Included in our discussion of the recent developments in CME-related phenomena are the latest developments from the STEREO and LASCO coronagraphs and the SMEI and HI heliospheric imagers."

2013_article_solar_phys_2013_284_167_178,"In this work, non-recurrent Forbush decreases (FDs) triggered by the passage of shock-driving interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) have been analyzed. Fifty- nine ICMEs have been studied, but only 25 % of them were associated to a FD. We find that shock-driving magnetic clouds (MCs) produce deeper FDs than shock-driving ejecta. This fact can be explained regarding the observed growing trends between decreases in neutron monitor (NM) count rate and MC/ejecta speed and its associated rigidity. MCs are faster and have higher associated rigidities than ejecta. Also the deceleration of ICMEs seems to be a cause for producing FDs, as can be inferred from the decreasing trend between NM count rate and deceleration. This probably implies that the interaction between the ICME traveling from the corona to the Earth and the solar wind can play an important role in producing deeper FDs. Finally, we conclude that ejecta without flux rope topology are the ones less effective in unchaining FDs."
2013_article_sun_and_geosphere_2012_7_1_65_70_issn_1819_0839,". The geomagnetic field (Bgeo) sets a lower cutoff rigidity (RC) to the entry of cosmic particles to Earth which depends on the geomagnetic activity. From numerical simulations of the trajectory of a proton using different models for Bgeo (performed with the MAGCOS code), we use backtracking to analyze particles arriving at the location of two nodes of the net LAGO (Large Aperture Gamma ray burst Observatory) that will be built in the near future: Buenos Aires and Marambio (Antarctica), Argentina. We determine the asymptotic trajectories and the values of RC for different incidence directions, for each node. Simulations were done using several models for Bgeo that emulate different geomagnetic conditions. The presented results will help to make analysis of future observations of the flux of cosmic rays done at these two LAGO nodes."

2014_article_mandrikova_et_al_earth_planets_and_space_2014_66_148,"In the present paper, we propose a wavelet-based method of describing variations in the Earth’s magnetic field, such as the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field, in addition to methods for evaluating changes in the energy characteristics of the field and for isolating the periods of increased geomagnetic activity. Based on a combination of multiresolution wavelet decompositions with neural networks, we propose a method of approximation of the cosmic ray time course and the allocation of anomalous variations (Forbush effects) that occur during periods of high solar activity. During the realization of the method, an algorithm was created for selecting the level of the wavelet decomposition and adaptive construction of the neural network. By using the proposed methods, we performed a joint analysis of the geomagnetic field and cosmic rays during periods of strong magnetic storms. The strongest geomagnetic field perturbations were observed in periods of abnormal changes in cosmic ray level. Assessment of the intensity of geomagnetic disturbances on the eve of and during magnetic storm development allowed us to highlight local increases in intensity of the geomagnetic field occurring at different frequency ranges prior to the development of the storm’s main phase. Implementation of the proposed method with theoretical tools in combination with other methods will improve the estimation accuracy of the geomagnetic field state during space weather forecasting.

Various parameters of the muon ﬂux anisotropy and methods of calculation of these parameters are discussed. It is shown that the horizontal projection of the muon ﬂux relative anisotropy vector which characterizes lateral (horizontal) displacement of the muon ﬂux angular distribution is the sensitive parameter to a variety of nonstationary processes in the heliosphere. The experimental data on the variation of the muon ﬂux anisotropy during the passage of various irregularities in the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld in the Earth’s vicinity are presented.

2016_article_the_temperature_effect_in_secondary_cosmic_rays_muons_observ,"The analysis of cosmic ray intensity variation seen by muon detectors at Earthʼs surface can help us to understand astrophysical, solar, interplanetary and geomagnetic phenomena. However, before comparing cosmic ray intensity variations with extraterrestrial phenomena, it is necessary to take into account atmospheric effects such as the temperature effect. In this work, we analyzed this effect on the Global Muon Detector Network (GMDN), which is composed of four ground-based detectors, two in the northern hemisphere and two in the southern hemisphere. In general, we found a higher temperature inﬂuence on detectors located in the northern hemisphere. Besides that, we noticed that the seasonal temperature variation observed at the ground and at the altitude of maximum muon production are in antiphase for all GMDN locations (low-latitude regions). In this way, contrary to what is expected in high-latitude regions, the ground muon intensity decrease occurring during summertime would be related to both parts of the temperature effect (the negative and the positive). We analyzed several methods to describe the temperature effect on cosmic ray intensity. We found that the mass weighted method is the one that best reproduces the seasonal cosmic ray variation observed by the GMDN detectors and allows the highest correlation with long-term variation of the cosmic ray intensity seen by neutron monitors. Key words: atmospheric effects – cosmic rays – solar–terrestrial relations – Sun: general"

2017_article_analysis_of_ground_level_enhancements_gle_extreme_solar_ener,"Nearly 70 Ground Level Enhancements (GLEs) of cosmic rays have been recorded by the worldwide neutron monitor network since the 1950s depicting a big variety of energy spectra of solar energetic particles (SEP). Here we studied a statistical relation between the event-integrated intensity of GLEs (calculated as count-rate relative excess, averaged over all available polar neutron monitors, and expressed in percent-hours) and the hardness of the solar particle energy spectra. For each event the integral omnidirectional event- integrated ﬂuences of particles with energy above 30 MeV (F 30 ) and above 200 MeV (F 200 ) were computed using the reconstructed spec- tra, and the ratio between the two ﬂuences was considered as a simple index of the event’s hardness. We also provided a justiﬁcation of the spectrum estimate in the form of the Band-function, using direct PAMELA data for GLE 71 (17-May-2012). We found that, while there is no clear relation between the intensity and the hardness for weak events, all strong events with the intensity greater 100 %*h are characterized by a very hard spectrum. This implies that a hard spectrum can be securely assumed for all extreme GLE events, e.g., those studied using cosmogenic isotope data in the past. Ó 2016 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

2018_article_the_influence_of_several_atmospheric_variables_on_cosmic_ray,"In this study, the eﬀects of atmospheric pressure and temperature on cosmic ray muons have been investigated using data recorded by the KACST detector (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Rc = 14.4 GV) for the beginning of the quiet periods of the 24th solar cycle. The muon data were, initially, correlated with the atmospheric pressure, and the desired coeﬃcient was obtained and used to eliminate the pressure eﬀect from the muon measurements. The pressure-corrected data are then analysed to study the eﬀect of the atmospheric temperature on cos- mic ray muons, using ﬁve methods. Four methods investigate the eﬀect of the ground temperature, the atmospheric temperatures and atmospheric heights at several atmospheric levels, on the measured muon rate. In the ﬁfth method, the muon data were correlated with the atmospheric weighted temperatures integrated up to diﬀerent atmospheric heights. For all cases, the desired correction coeﬃcients were obtained, and their variations at several atmospheric levels were studied. The obtained coeﬃcients were then used to correct the cosmic ray data. We found that the atmospheric pressure eﬀect shows the greatest diﬀerences between the corrected and uncorrected rate (up to 1%). Instead, corrections made to the muon data using the remainder of the considered parameters modify the muon rate by a small amount (less than 0.5%) compared to the uncorrected rate. Ó 2018 COSPAR.

2019_article_1_29_cosmic_rays,"Revised October 2019 by J.J. Beatty (Ohio State U.), J. Matthews (Louisiana State U.) and S.P. Wakely (Chicago U.; Chicago U., Kavli Inst.). Cosmic rays are a population of energetic elementary particles and nuclei with a steeply falling near-power law spectrum extending from a few MeV to tens of Joules per particle. Primary cosmic rays can be measured directly by experiments in space or on balloons at energies where there is sufficient flux (§29.1). Atmospheric interactions of primary cosmic rays produce fluxes of secondary elementary particles which can be detected in the atmosphere (§29.2), at the Earth’s surface (§29.3), and underground (§29.4). At high energies, air showers of particles generated by a single primary can be detected (§29.5). These showers can be reconstructed to determine the energy, direction, and composition of the incident particle. Energetic neutrinos are closely linked to high energy cosmic rays, both through their production at astrophysical sites of particle acceleration and by production during propagation of extremely high energy cosmic rays (§29.6). 29.1 Primary Spectra from Direct Measurements The cosmic radiation incident at the top of the terrestrial atmosphere includes all stable charged particles and nuclei with lifetimes of order 106 years or longer. When discussing the astrophysical origin of cosmic rays, “primary” cosmic rays are those particles accelerated at astrophysical sources and “secondaries” are those particles produced in interaction of the primaries with interstellar gas1 . Thus electrons, protons and helium, as well as carbon, oxygen, iron, and other nuclei synthesized in stars, are primaries. Nuclei such as lithium, beryllium, and boron (which are not abundant end- products of stellar nucleosynthesis) are secondaries. Antiprotons and positrons are also in large part secondary. Whether a small fraction of these particles may be primary is a question of current interest. Apart from particles associated with solar flares2 , the cosmic radiation comes from outside the solar system. The incoming charged particles are “modulated” by the solar wind, the expanding magnetized plasma generated by the Sun, which decelerates and partially excludes the lower energy galactic cosmic rays from the inner solar system. There is a significant anticorrelation between solar activity (which has an alternating eleven-year cycle) and the intensity of the cosmic rays with rigidities below about 10 GV. In addition, the lower-energy cosmic rays are affected by the geomagnetic field, which they must penetrate to reach the top of the atmosphere. Thus the intensity of any component of the cosmic radiation in the GeV range depends both on the location and time. There are four different ways to describe the spectra of the components of the cosmic radiation: (1) By particles per unit rigidity. Propagation (and probably also acceleration) through cosmic magnetic fields depends on gyroradius or magnetic rigidity, R, which is gyroradius multiplied by the magnetic field strength:"

2019_article_atmospheric_muons_measured_with_icecube,". IceCube is a cubic-kilometer Cherenkov detector in the deep ice at the geographic South Pole. The dominant event yield is produced by penetrating atmospheric muons with energies above several 100 GeV. Due to its large detector volume, IceCube provides unique opportunities to study atmospheric muons with large statistics in detail. Measurements of the energy spectrum and the lateral separation distribution of muons offer insights into hadronic interactions during the air shower development and can be used to test hadronic models. We will present an overview of various measurements of atmospheric muons in IceCube, including the energy spectrum of muons between 10 TeV and 1 PeV. This is used to derive an estimate of the prompt contribution of muons, originating from the decay of heavy (mainly charmed) hadrons and unflavored mesons. We will also present measurements of the lateral separation distributions of TeV muons between 150 m and 450 m for several initial cosmic ray energies between 1 PeV and 16 PeV. Finally, the angular distribution of atmospheric muons in IceCube will be discussed."

Introduction Received 10 FEB 2020 Cosmic rays (c.r.) are messengers from outer space that provide valuable information for different research Accepted 30 MAY 2020 areas, such as space weather, high‐energy physics, and cosmology (Hayashi et al., 2005; Pierre Auger Accepted article online 11 JUN 2020 Collaboration, 2015). Speciﬁcally, ground‐based instruments give us the chance to study the products of the interactions between primary cosmic rays and the nuclei in the atmosphere. These products consist of secondary particles that traverse the atmosphere carrying information about its inner structure, as in a radio- graphy, providing information about its properties. Secondary muons, in particular, are affected by atmo- spheric pressure and temperature. These induce local modiﬁcations of the atmospheric density and its depth, thereby changing the balance between particle production, absorption and decay, affecting the muon rates at the ground (Dorman, 2004). Since modern muon detectors are mostly committed to the study of solar activity and other astrophysical phenomena, such effects are regularly removed with simple techniques, as part of a calibration procedure (De Mendonça et al., 2013). Our work is concerned with a deeper comprehen- sion of such atmospheric effects. The rates of c.r. measured at the Earth's surface vary according to changes in several atmospheric conditions, chieﬂy the pressure at ground level and the temperature proﬁle of the atmosphere. The pressure (or baro- metric) effect arises mainly due to the absorption of the radiation in the atmosphere through energy loss. The more the pressure, the more air mass to traverse. Therefore, secondary c.r. particles are more efﬁciently absorbed, and, consequently, the measured rates are modulated in anticorrelation with the ground‐level pressure. In detail, the mass increase is associated with a larger height of the air column, which modiﬁes the decay probabilities of the particles involved, implying a nonnegligible (but subdominant) contribution ©2020.

The detector made a two-way journey on board of the Spanish vessel Sarmiento de Gamboa between Vigo (Spain) and Punta Arenas (Chile), measuring continuously the cosmic-ray rate throughout the Atlantic crossing. In this work, we present the results of the first journey, correlating the obtained variation of the cosmic-ray rate with the vertical cutoff rigidity, as well as presenting some details of the detector and its autonomous DAQ system used during the campaign."
2020_article_voxelization_based_poca_point_cloud_filtration_algorithm_for,"Multiple Coulomb Scattering (MCS) based muon tomography technique has been considered to be a well-known tool to identify, discriminate, and to image the high-density objects placed inside closed volumes. The two most famous reconstruction algorithms are Point of Closest Approach (PoCA) and Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM). PoCA is fast but purely geometrical and as a result of this, it gives a lot of false positives, i.e. sometimes the PoCA point lies outside the target object and hence it forms an envelope of false-positive which results in a smeared image. On the other hand, MLEM is an iterative algorithm and is much more computation-intensive. In this work a new and innovative method is proposed which is based on the concept of voxelization to handle the known problem of false positives of the PoCA algorithm, and hence provide a clear reconstructed image. These algorithms remove the false positives PoCA points from the 3D point cloud and will give useful information in terms of regions or voxels within a voxelized volume ‘V’ to do a clear image reconstruction. The advantages of the proposed algorithm to the existing algorithms are also discussed. The status of the experimental setup of the proposed facility using Resistive Plate Chamber(RPC) with spatial resolution of ∼ 1cm as muon detector, is also discussed. The preliminary data from the current experimental setup, showing detector performance and cosmic muon tracks are also shown. Since the experimental setup is not fully ready, the effectiveness of the developed algorithms and the results are evaluated using the data from the Geant4 simulation of the muon tomography setup."

2020_book_lee2012_book_introductiontosmoothmanifolds,"topological spaces, not necessarily as subsets of larger spaces. It is not hard to see that there is no way to define a purely topological property that would serve as a criterion for “smoothness,” because it cannot be invariant under homeomorphisms. For example, a circle and a square in the plane are homeomor- phic topological spaces (Fig. 1.1), but we would probably all agree that the circle is “smooth,” while the square is not. Thus, topological manifolds will not suffice for our purposes. Instead, we will think of a smooth manifold as a set with two layers of structure: first a topology, then a smooth structure. In the first section of this chapter we describe the first of these structures. A topo- logical manifold is a topological space with three special properties that express the notion of being locally like Euclidean space. These properties are shared by Eu- clidean spaces and by all of the familiar geometric objects that look locally like Euclidean spaces, such as curves and surfaces. We then prove some important topo- logical properties of manifolds that we use throughout the book. In the next section we introduce an additional structure, called a smooth structure, that can be added to a topological manifold to enable us to make sense of derivatives. Following the basic definitions, we introduce a number of examples of manifolds, so you can have something concrete in mind as you read the general theory. At the end of the chapter we introduce the concept of a smooth manifold with boundary, an important generalization of smooth manifolds that will have numerous applications throughout the book, especially in our study of integration in Chapter 16."

2021_article_development_of_crosshair_light_sharing_pet_detector_with_tof,"Objective. Time-of-ﬂight (TOF) and depth-of-interaction (DOI) are well recognized as important information to improve PET image quality. Since such information types are not correlated, many TOF-DOI detectors have been developed but there are only a few reports of high-resolution detectors (e.g. 1.5 mm resolution) for brain PET systems. Based on the DOI detector, which enables single- ended readout by optically coupling a pair of crystals and having a loop structure, we have developed the crosshair light sharing (CLS) PET detector that optically couples the four-loop structure, consisting of quadrisected crystals comparable in size to a photo-sensor, to four photo-sensors in close proximity arranged in a windmill shape. Even as a high-resolution detector, the CLS PET detector could obtain both TOF and DOI information. The coincidence resolving time (CRT) of the CLS PET detector needs to be further improved, however, for application to the brain PET system. Recently, a fast LGSO crystal was developed which has advantages in detection efﬁciency and CRT compared to the GFAG crystal. In this work, we developed the CLS PET detector using the fast LGSO crystal for the TOF-DOI brain PET system. Approach. The crystals were each 1.45×1.45×15 mm3 and all surfaces were chemically etched. The CLS PET detector consisted of a 14×14 crystal array optically coupled to an 8×8 MPPC array. Main results. The fast LGSO array provided 10.1% energy resolution at 511 keV, 4.7 mm DOI resolution at 662 keV, and 293 ps CRT with the energy window of 440–620 keV. Signiﬁcance. The developed CLS PET detector has 290% higher coincidence sensitivity, 30% better energy resolution, and 32% better time resolution compared to our previous CLS PET detector."
2021_article_doi_estimation_through_signal_arrival_time_distribution_a_th,"The challenge to reach 10 ps coincidence time resolution (CTR) in time-of-ﬂight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET) is triggering major efforts worldwide, but timing improvements of scintillation detectors will remain elusive without depth-of-interaction (DOI) correction in long crystals. Nonetheless, this momentum opportunely brings up the prospect of a fully time-based DOI estimation since fast timing signals intrinsically carry DOI information, even with a traditional single- ended readout. Consequently, extracting features of the detected signal time distribution could uncover the spatial origin of the interaction and in return, provide enhancement on the timing precision of detectors. We demonstrate the validity of a time-based DOI estimation concept in two steps. First, experimental measurements were carried out with current LSO:Ce:Ca crystals coupled to FBK NUV-HD SiPMs read out by fast high-frequency electronics to provide new evidence of a distinct DOI effect on CTR not observable before with slower electronics. Using this detector, a DOI discrimination using a double-threshold scheme on the analog timing signal together with the signal intensity information was also developed without any complex readout or detector modiﬁcation. As a second step, we explored by simulation the anticipated performance requirements of future detectors to efﬁciently estimate the DOI and we proposed four estimators that exploit either more generic or more precise features of the DOI-dependent timestamp distribution. A simple estimator using the time difference between two timestamps provided enhanced CTR. Additional improvements were achieved with estimators using multiple timestamps (e.g. kernel density estimation and neural network) converging to the Cramér–Rao lower bound developed in this work for a time-based DOI estimation. This two-step study provides insights on current and future possibilities in exploiting the timing signal features for DOI estimation aiming at ultra-fast CTR while maintaining detection efﬁciency for TOF PET."

2021_article_prepared_for_submission_to_jinst,"Muon tomography or “muography” is an emerging imaging technique that uses cos- mogenic muons as the radiation source. Due to its diverse range of applications and the use of natural radiation, muography is being applied across many fields such as geology, archaeology, civil engineering, nuclear reactor monitoring, nuclear waste characterization, underground surveys, etc. Muons can be detected using various detector technologies, among which, resistive plate chambers (RPC) are a very cost effective choice. RPCs are planar detectors which use ionization in a thin gas gap to detect cosmic muons, already used since years in major particle accelerator experiments. We have developed a muon telescope (or “muoscope”) composed of small scale RPCs. The design goal for our muoscope is to be portable and autonomous, in order to take data in places that are not easily accessible. The whole setup is light and compact, such to be easily packed in a car trunk. Individual RPCs are hosted in gas-tight aluminium cases. There is no need for gas bottles, once the chambers are filled. The muoscope can be controlled from a reasonable distance using wireless connection. In this paper we summarize the guiding principles of our project and present some recent developments and future prospects, including a long-term stability study of the resistivity of the semiconductive coating obtained with serigraphy."

These maps display the eﬀective cut-oﬀ rigidity in every ﬁve degrees in latitude and in longitude at the altitude of 20 km above the surface of the international reference ellipsoid. The values of the geomagnetic cut-oﬀ rigidity were calculated in every 5° in latitude and in every 15° in longitude applying the well-known method of particle trajectory calculations resulted from the theory of the particle motion in the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. The applied software employed the 12th Generation of the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF 12) and trajectories were calculated at 0.01 GV intervals in order to determine the vertical cut-oﬀ rigidity for each location. Beyond the use of the calculated cut-oﬀ rigidity values as a basic reference of charged particle access to diﬀerent geographical locations during quiet and/or more intense geomagnetic periods, these results can be used for a long- term forecasting of the geomagnetic conditions variations.

2022_article_facultade_de_f_sica,"CALIFA detector is a gamma and light charged particle calorimeter that is part of the R3 B complete and inverse kinematics experiment located at the GSI-FAIR. CALIFA is composed of 2544 CsI(Tl) scintillator units attached to APD-type solid-state detectors assembled in the shape of a capped barrel around a collision target. This detector is essentially made up of two parts: the Barrel, the central body, and the EndCap, the front part, which in turn is subdivided into iPhos and CEPA, the Very Forward part, which is still in construction. All CALIFA is made up of crystals, although of dierent geometry, of the same material. Our objective is to study the viability of introducing a GAGG-CsI(Tl) Phoswich (Phosphor Sandwich) in CEPA to achieve a more complete characterization of the particles that travel in this angular range. To this end, an order was made for four GAGG units from Epic Crystal Co., Ltd (China) in lengths of 70, 80, 90 and 100 mm with the aim of characterizing them, bonding them to CsI(Tl) pieces of complementary size and assembling an alveolus of a petal of CEPA. However, manufacturing errors meant that only two of the four GAGG ordered were received, which also showed visual defects, such as turbidity or white spots, at the time of arrival at the laboratory, and whose characterization showed frontal resolutions of 13 % for the 80 mm and 14 % for the 90 mm, disproportionate for the 7 % indicated by the company or the 9 % obtained from a 50 mm long GAGG in Phoswich scintillator assembly for medical imaging (PHARMI).

2022_article_fieldable_muon_spectrometer_using_multi_layer_pressurized_ga,"OPEN Fieldable muon spectrometer using multi‑layer pressurized gas Cherenkov radiators and its applications Junghyun Bae* & Stylianos Chatzidakis Cosmic ray muons have been considered as a non-conventional radiation probe in various applications. To utilize cosmic ray muons in engineering applications, two important quantities, trajectory and momentum, must be known. The muon trajectories are easily reconstructed using two-fold detector arrays with a high spatial resolution. However, precise measurement of muon momentum is difficult to be achieved without deploying large and expensive spectrometers such as solenoid magnets. Here, we propose a new method to estimate muon momentum using multi-layer pressurized gas Cherenkov radiators. This is accurate, portable, compact (< ­1m3), and easily coupled with existing muon detectors without the need of neither bulky magnetic nor time-of-flight spectrometers. The results show that not only our new muon spectrometer can measure muon momentum with a resolution of ± 0.5 GeV/c in a momentum range of 0.1–10.0 GeV/c, but also we can reconstruct cosmic muon spectrum with high accuracy (~ 90%)."

Keywords: CMB polarization; CubeSat; calibration source; B-modes. This study introduces W-CalSat, a calibration satellite deployed in a Low Earth Orbit that emits a polarized signal in the W-band microwave frequency range. The primary objective is to capita- lize on the enhanced sensitivity of the next-generation cosmic microwave background (CMB) teles- copes to achieve highly precise measurements of the B-mode of polarization, speci cally associated with the curl-like polarization component arising from gravitational waves in certain in ationary mo- dels. Given the inherently weak nature of the CMB polarized signal, precise calibration processes are essential prior to conducting measurement campaigns. Although celestial sources such as the Crab Nebula or Jupiter are commonly employed for calibration, their imperfect characterization and insuf- cient brightness present limitations.

2023_article_measurements_of_cosmic_ray_mass_composition_with_the_icecube,". The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a multi-component detector at the South Pole. Besides study- ing high-energy neutrinos, it is capable of measuring high-energy cosmic rays from PeV to EeV. This energy region is thought to cover the transition from galactic to extragalactic sources of cosmic rays. The observatory consists of the deep in-ice IceCube array, which measures the high-energy (≥ 500 GeV) muonic component, and the IceTop surface array, which is sensitive to the electromagnetic and low-energy muonic part of an air shower. The primary energy and the mass composition can be measured simultaneously by applying statistical methods including modern machine-learning techniques to reconstruct cosmic ray air showers. In this contri- bution, we will discuss recent improvements to the reconstruction techniques, the mass composition sensitivity, and an outlook on future improved measurements with the full surface scintillator/radio array to mitigate snow accumulation and measure the air shower maximum Xmax using imaging air-Cherenkov telescopes IceAct."
2023_article_parallelization_of_garfield_and_nebem_to_simulate_space_char,"Numerical simulation of avalanches, saturated avalanches, and streamers can help us understand the detector physics of Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC). 3D Monte Carlo simulation of an avalanche inside an RPC, the transition from avalanche to saturated avalanche to streamer may help the search for the optimum voltage and alternate gas mixtures. This task is dauntingly re- source hungry, especially when space-charge effects become important, which often coincides with important regimes of operation of these devices. By mod- ifying the electric field inside the RPC dynamically, the space charge plays a crucial role in determining the response of the detector. In this work, a numerical model has been proposed to calculate the dynamic space-charge field inside an RPC and the same has been implemented in the Garfield++ framework. By modeling space charge as large number of line charges and using the multithreading technique OpenMP to calculate electric field, drift line, electron gain, and space-charge field, it has been possible to maintain time consumption within reasonable limits. For this purpose, a new class, pAvalancheMC has been introduced in Garfield++. The calculations have been successfully verified with those from existing solvers and an example is provided to show the performance of pAvalancheMC. Moreover, the details"

2024_article_anisotropic_forbush_decrease_of_24_march_2024_first_look,"A strong Forbush decrease, i.e., suppression of the ﬂux of galactic cosmic rays recorded on Earth, was observed by the global network of ground-based neutron monitors (NMs) on 24 – 25 March 2024. The decrease was very unusual as characterised by so rapid recovery that a false Ground-level enhancement (GLE) alarm was produced by the corresponding warning systems. Here we present the ﬁrst com- prehensive collection and analysis of the available data for this event. The event was highly anisotropic as exhibited in a 3-h spread of the deep-phase timing for diﬀerent NMs. The anisotropy was focused nearly at the anti-sunward direction with a narrow cone of 20 – 30 . The heliospheric situation leading to this unusual Forbush decrease was quite complex. An analysis of ﬁrst look records was performed, considering the stations acceptance, taking into account the complex geomagnetic conditions. A leader fraction analysis indicates that the recovery phase of the event was rigidity-independent and had essentially the same spectral shape as the pre-event period. A summary of the solar-terrestrial phenomena is provided to assist in future work on modelling this complex event. Ó 2024 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

2024_article_bright_innovations_review_of_next_generation_advances_in_sci,"This review focuses on modern scintillators, the heart of ionizing radiation detection with applications in medical diagnostics, homeland security, research, and other areas. The conventional method to improve their character- istics, such as light output and timing properties, consists of improving in material composition and doping, etc., which are intrinsic to the material. On the contrary, we review recent advancements in cutting-edge approaches to shape scintillator characteristics via photonic and metamaterial engineering, which are extrinsic and introduce controlled inhomogeneity in the scintillator’s surface or volume. The methods to be discussed include improved light out-coupling using photonic crystal (PhC) coating, dielectric architecture modification producing the Purcell effect, and meta-materials engineering based on energy sharing. These approaches help to break traditional bulk scintillators’ limitations, e.g., to deal with poor light extraction efficiency from the material due to a typically large refractive index mismatch or improve timing performance compared to bulk materials. In the Outlook section, modern physical phenomena are discussed and suggested as the basis for the next generations of scintillation-based detectors and technology, followed by a brief discussion on cost-effective fabrication techniques that could be scalable.

2024_article_evolution_of_the_cosmic_ray_spectrum_during_a_forbush_decrea,"The Antarctic Cosmic Ray Observatory (ORCA) has been in continuous operation since January 2020 and in nominal phase since March 2021 at the Spanish Antarctic Base Juan Carlos I (Livingston Island, Antarctica 62 390 4600 S; 60 230 2000 W at 12 m above sea level) at an eﬀective vertical cutoﬀ rigidity of R ¼ 2:37 GV. ORCA consists of two neutron monitors, ORC-A with three BF3 counter tubes following the NM64 standard, and ORC-B, with three bare BF3 counter tubes; and a muon telescope, ORC-M consisting of two 1 m2 scintillators with the neutron monitors between them. ORCA provides neutron count rates at two diﬀerent energy thresholds (pro- vided by ORC-A and ORC-B) and muon count rates and muon incidence directions throughout the ORCA volume. The neutron- producing cosmic rays observed in ORC-A have a lower rigidity threshold than the muon-producing ones observed in ORC-M. The relationship between them gives an idea about the change in the slope of the cosmic ray spectrum at the corresponding thresholds, 2.37 GV for ORC-A and  12 GV for ORC-M. This relation allows to investigate the change in the cosmic ray spectrum along the dif- ferent regions in an Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection, i.e. the shock, the sheath and the magnetic cloud. ORCA ﬁrst observations are presented, focusing on the analysis of the Forbush Decrease (FD) that happened at the beginning of November 2021. We present these observations and show the promising capabilities of the Antarctic Cosmic Ray Observatory, which represents a new concept of cosmic ray and solar energetic particle detector. The cosmic ray spectrum changes during the Forbush decrease detected in early Novem- ber 2021 as seen in the change in the ratio of ORC-A to ORC-M count rates. This change is clear after the arrival of the shock and during the magnetic cloud being smoother or even ﬂat in the sheath. In addition, the secondary muons show changes in their arrival directions along the ICME, being clear the diﬀerent behavior in shock, sheath and magnetic cloud. Ó 2024 COSPAR.

2024_article_stability_studies_of_sealed_resistive_plate_chambers,"The phase-out of hydro-fluorocarbons, due to their high Global Warming Power, affecting the main gas used in Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs), tetrafluoroethane C2 H2 F4 , has increased pressure on existing systems and imposes strong restrictions on its use in new systems. This has motivated the beginning of a new line of R&D on sealed RPCs, RPCs that do not require a continuous gas flow for their operation and dispense the use of very complex and expensive re-circulation and/or recycling gas systems. At the moment it is not clear whether this solution can cover all fields of application normally allocated to RPCs, but it seems that it could be considered as a valid option for low flux triggering/tracking of particles, e.g. in cosmic ray or rare event experiments. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of a small telescope for atmospheric muon tracking consisting of four 300 x 300 mm2 sealed RPCs with gas gap widths of 1 mm, 1.5 mm and 2 mm. The results suggest that it is possible to operate this type of detectors for extended periods of time (more than five months) with its main characteristics mainly: efficiency, average charge and streamer probability, without apparent degradation and similar to a RPC operated in continuous gas flow.

2024_article_unusual_forbush_decreases_and_geomagnetic_storms_on_24_march,"As the current solar cycle 25 progresses and moves towards solar maxima, solar activity is increasing and extreme space weather events are taking place. Two severe geomagnetic storms accompanied by two large Forbush decreases in galactic cosmic ray intensity were recorded in March and May, 2024. More precisely, on 24 March 2024, a G4 (according to the NOAA Space Weather Scale for Geomagnetic Storms) geomagnetic storm was registered, with the corresponding geomagnetic indices Kp and Dst equal to 8 and −130 nT, respectively. On the same day, the majority of ground- based neutron monitor stations recorded an unusual Forbush decrease. This event stands out from a Citation: Mavromichalaki, H.; typical Forbush decrease because of its high amplitude decrease phase and rapid recovery phase, i.e., Papailiou, M.-C.; Livada, M.; 15% decrease and an extremely rapid recovery of 10% within 1.5 h, as recorded at the Oulu neutron Gerontidou, M.; Paschalis, P.; monitor station. Furthermore, on 10–13 May 2024, an unusual G5 geomagnetic storm (geomagnetic Stassinakis, A.; Abunina, M.; Shlyk, indices Kp = 9 and Dst = −412 nT) was registered (the last G5 storm had been observed in 2003).

Understanding the angu- lar dependence of low momentum cosmic-ray muons at the surface is necessary for these calculations. Heuristically, from examination of the data, a simple parameter- ization is proposed, based on a straighforward scaling variable. This in turn, allows a universal calculation of the differential muon intensity at the surface for all zenith angles and essentially all momenta."

2025_article_accurate_cataloging_of_forbush_decreases_implications_for_sp,"Forbush decreases (FDs) are short-term reductions in the time-intensity flux of cosmic rays (CRs). Their spectacular and unpredictable intensity variations present their detection, timing, magnitude estimation, and cataloging as one of the most difficult tasks in space weather research. Due to the paucity of accurate event lists, new methods of event detection and FD catalogs continue to appear in the literature. But validation of either the old or new lists remains an open field. This work intends to remind the astrophysicist and space weather community that dramatic modifications of the age-long manual/semi- manual FD event cataloging are long overdue. In this present era of extremely fast and sophisticated computer algorithms, a complementary automated list of all the manually created FD catalogs, especially the IZMIRAN (Pushkin Institute of Terres- trial Magnetism, Ionosphere, and Radio Wave Propagation, Russian Academy of Sciences, http://spaceweather.izmiran.ru/ eng/dbs.html) (which is the currently available and widely used lists) should have been developed, the old lists expanded and new catalogs created. A Fourier decomposition technique, which guarantees the sinusoidal fidelity of the input and output signals, is presented. This highlights the possibility of a complete algorithm-based FD cataloging with the aim of stimulating other automated methodological approaches. The impossibility of creating accurate FD lists without first disentangling the contribution from diurnal CR anisotropy and the 11-year solar oscillation was qualitatively analyzed. Using a set of CR data from Moscow station, we automatically created four different FD catalogs − FD1 from the raw data without adjusting for the contribution from the 11-year solar cycle oscillation or CR anisotropy, FD2 after adjusting for the 11-year solar cycle effects, FD3 after adjusting for CR anisotropy and FD4 after adjusting for both the 11-year and CR anisotropy. This allows us to practically demonstrate the possible discrepancies among different FD catalogs and the attendant bias implications on FD-based space weather investigation. Given the detailed analyses performed, FD4 is the most accurate FD list. This serves as an evidence that accurate FD catalog is realizable. We also establish that several of the events in FD1, FD2 and FD3 catalogs may be intensity reductions/spurious events arising from other CR phenomena like anisotropies."

Santos Writing – review & editing: N. Gómez, 1. Introduction S. Dasso, A. M. Gulisano Climate variability in the lower stratosphere is associated with processes involving different temporal scales. For example, the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is the leading mode of atmospheric variability in the extratropical Southern Hemisphere and is characterized by a mostly zonally symmetric mass oscillation with anti‐correlated pressure anomalies over the mid‐latitudes and Antarctica. Its intensity or polarity can change in response to external forcing, such as Antarctic stratospheric ozone depletion and greenhouse gas increases (Fogt & Marshall, 2020). In particular, the variability of SAM during the spring‐summer transition has been shown to be sensitive to the conditions of the polar stratospheric vortex during spring (Byrne & Shepherd, 2018; Kidston © 2025 The Author(s). et al., 2015). On the other hand, the sub‐seasonal variability of stratospheric ozone is highly sensitive to the This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons dynamic conditions of the stratosphere (Leovy et al., 1985). Additionally, long‐term changes in the mean Attribution‐NonCommercial License, stratosphere conditions due to the depletion of stratospheric ozone at the end of the 20th century and its slow which permits use, distribution and recovery during the 21st century have been associated with the migration of the tropospheric jet (Banerjee reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited and is not et al., 2020).

2025_article_cosmic_ray_energy_and_composition_measurements_with_grapes_3,"Cosmic rays (CRs) are charged nuclei accelerated by natural astrophysical processes to extremely high energies. Despite signiﬁcant progress in CR research over the past century, their origin and the astro- physical processes responsible for accelerating them to such high energies have yet to be fully understood. A comprehensive understanding requires precise measurement of their energy spectrum and mass compo- sition. This article reviews the CR energy spectrum and mass composition measurements above 100 GeV. The CR energy spectrum is generally described by a power law, with notable spectral features commonly referred to as the knee, ankle, and ﬂux suppression. Direct experiments oﬀer high-precision measurements in the GeV–TeV energy range and have revealed spectral hardening around a few hundred GeV and soft- ening near several tens of TeV in the proton and helium spectra. At energies above hundreds of TeV, CRs are observed by indirect experiments using extensive air showers (EASs). Indirect measurements have also observed further spectral features, such as the hardening in light primaries near hundreds of TeV, the second knee, and the instep. This article highlights the GRAPES-3 experiment, in Ooty, India, focusing on the methodology of using muon multiplicity to estimate mass composition and the observation of spectral hardening at 166 TeV in the CR proton spectrum. These observed spectral features provide important con- straints for reﬁning theoretical models of CR origin, acceleration, and propagation. Indirect measurements, particularly of mass composition, are subject to large systematic uncertainties because the interpretation of observables relies on simulations based on hadronic interaction models. This article brieﬂy discusses signiﬁcant discrepancies in mass composition results arising from the limited theoretical understanding of these models, emphasizing the need for improved hadronic interaction modeling."

An array of ground-surface detectors can reveal the secondary particles, which originate from the interaction of cosmic rays with the atmosphere. In this work, we present an investigation of the low-threshold rate (scaler) time series recorded in 16 years of operation by the Pierre Auger Observatory surface detectors in Malargüe, Argentina. Through an advanced spectral analysis, we detected highly statistically significant variations in the time series with periods ranging from the decadal to the daily scale. We investigate their origin, revealing a direct connection with solar variability. Thanks to their intrinsic very low noise level, the Auger scalers allow a thorough and detailed investigation of the galactic cosmic-ray flux variations in the heliosphere at different timescales and can, therefore, be considered a new proxy of solar variability."

2025_article_high_latitude_observation_of_the_forbush_decrease_during_the,"During the series of intense solar ﬂares and coronal mass ejections, that occurred in May 2024, a remarkable Forbush decrease in the cosmic ray ﬂux was observed on the Earth. While this event was observed by particle detectors around the world, the archipelago of Svalbard was heavily exposed to it due to the weak geomagnetic shielding in the polar region. In this study, an analysis of the Forbush decrease event was carried out with a unique combination of muon and neutron detectors on Svalbard: at Ny-Alesund three scintillator- based muon telescopes of the Extreme Energy Events (EEE) project, 14 channels of a Bonner Sphere neutron Spectrometer (BSS), and thermal and epithermal neutron sensors used for hydrological monitoring; and, at Barentsburg, a high-energy neutron monitor operated by the Polar Geophysical Institute. Most sensors showed signiﬁcant responses and correlation during the event. The observed relative magnitude of the Forbush decrease was found to depend on the detector’s energy sensitivity and was 9 for thermal neutrons, 8 for high-energy neutrons, and 3 for muons. The uncertainty of these results strongly depends on factors like the count rate, which ranged from 101 to 105 cph and resulted in a low signal-to-noise ratio particularly for the BSS. These multi-particle and multi- energy observations provide an unprecendented view on the Earth’s exposure to cosmic rays during solar events. © 2025 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

It is possible to obtain the most critical properties of a cosmic ray, including the depth of shower maximum, energy, and type of primary particle, from radio measurements. Semnan University Radio Array is a new experi- ment that strives to detect radio emissions from extensive air showers induced by ultra-high energy cosmic rays. To fully harness the potential of the radio detection method in a self-trigger setup, it is essential to have artificial digital and analog filters to eliminate major unwanted emissions, analog-to-digital converters with appropriate specifications for accurate signal reconstruction, and data processing units capable of implementing software- based analysis alongside advanced digital signal processing techniques. This paper describes the design and implementation of a self-triggering approach in SURA-4 as the first phase of the SURA experiment to preserve cosmic ray candidates while removing unwanted emissions by utilizing the capabilities of analog and digital elements and incorporating a custom software framework for radio signal analyses. The ultimate validation of this approach for reliably distinguishing cosmic rays from anthropogenic radio frequency interferences will be pursued in future experiment phases, including cross-verification with three particle detectors."

We also find CIR‐induced FDs do not have strongly compressed magnetosphere. We suggest that when the magnetosphere is strongly compressed, the turbulence levels in the magnetosheath and inside the magnetosphere greatly enhance, and this enhancement helps to further reduce the cosmic ray flux, besides the engulfing CMEs."
2025_article_monolithic_plastic_scintillator_detectors_novel_concepts_and,"Monolithic Plastic Scintillator Detectors: Novel Concepts and Frontier Developments Hybrid SiPM Readout Architectures (Surface & Side Mounts) Monolithic plastic scintillator detectors – one-piece scintillation slabs rather than segmented strips or tiles – are being reimagined with hybrid readout schemes to improve spatial resolution and signal uniformity. In particular, researchers have explored placing Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) on both the broad faces and the edges of a scintillator (“surface-mounted” and “side-mounted” sensors) to capture scintillation light from multiple vantage points. By combining signals from top/bottom surfaces and side facets, a more complete sampling of the photon distribution is obtained, mitigating position- dependent response non-uniformities. For example, a recent proton beam monitor uses a 25×25×1 mm³ EJ-204 plastic scintillator coupled to four SiPMs on its edges, allowing the particle’s incident position to be triangulated from the share of light each SiPM receives 1 . This prototype achieved ~2 mm (rms) spatial resolution for single protons, illustrating how multi-sided readout in a monolithic slab can rival finely segmented detectors 1 ."
2025_article_monolithic_scintillator_detectors_read_out_by_sipm_arrays_st,"Monolithic Scintillator Detectors Read Out by SiPM Arrays – State of the Art Background and Motivation Traditional cosmic muon detectors often use plastic scintillator segments (bars or tiles) read out at the edges by photomultipliers or SiPMs. A classic example is the CosmicWatch muon detector, which uses a single SiPM coupled to a 5×5×1 cm scintillator block 1 . Such single-sensor designs can detect muons but cannot localize the muon’s hit position on the scintillator, since they only measure the integrated light output of one monolithic piece 1 . Achieving spatial resolution normally requires breaking the detector into many small scintillator strips or tiles (forming a hodoscope or matrix of narrow counters). However, fine segmentation is costly – fabricating scintillators into many fine strips greatly increases material and processing expenses 2 . This motivates monolithic scintillator designs that preserve a continuous detection area while using multiple readout channels to infer the muon’s position."
2025_article_monolithic_vs_segmented_scintillator_detectors_in_modern_exp,"Monolithic vs. Segmented Scintillator Detectors in Modern Experiments Monolithic scintillator detectors refer to large, continuous scintillating blocks (plastic or inorganic) that are read out by arrays of photosensors (SiPMs, PMTs, etc.), as opposed to segmented scintillators which divide the detector volume into many smaller optically isolated pieces (tiles, bars, crystals) each with individual readout. This distinction is crucial in high-energy and nuclear physics experiments, as it impacts detector granularity, calibration, and performance. Over the last 10–15 years, most large experiments have continued to rely on segmented scintillators for calorimetry and tracking because of their well-understood reconstruction advantages, while monolithic designs are mainly explored in R&D prototypes and niche applications 1 . Below we survey how monolithic scintillators are being developed and applied at major labs (CERN, Fermilab, J-PARC/KEK, etc.), in both primary detector systems (calorimeters, trackers) and auxiliary systems (muon vetoes, beam monitors, timing layers).

Additionally, the high cost of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) has limited the widespread adoption of scintillator detectors as position-sensitive detectors in particle and nuclear physics ex- periments. In recent years, thanks to the rapid development of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), their excellent cost-performance ratio has led to a renewed interest in scintillator detectors in par- ticle and nuclear physics.

2025_article_prepared_for_submission_to_jinst,"Atmospheric muons are important probes for studying primary cosmic rays and extensive air showers. Additionally, they constitute a significant background for many underground and deep-sea neutrino experiments, such as TRopIcal DEep-sea Neutrino Telescope (TRIDENT). Understanding the muon flux at various depths in the deep sea is essential for validating TRIDENT simulations and guiding the development of optimized trigger strategies. This paper introduces a novel device based on plastic scintillators and silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) named MuonSLab, which is designed to measure muon flux in the deep sea and has the potential to be extended to other atmospheric muon property measurements. We discuss the design and instrumentation of MuonSLab and present results from several muon flux measurements, demonstrating its sensitivity to muon detection and its stability during operations across multiple locations."
2025_article_research_article_july_08_2025,"Muography, traditionally recognized as a potent instrument for imaging the internal structure of gigantic objects, has initialized various interdisciplinary applications. As the financial and labor costs of muography detector development hinder their massive applications, we develop a novel muon detector called MuGrid by coupling a monolithic plastic scintillator with a light guide array in order to achieve com- petitive spatial resolution while substantially reducing production costs. For a prototype detector in 30  30 cm2 , the intrinsic spatial resolu- tion has been optimized toward a millimeter scale. An outdoor field muography experiment was conducted to monitor two buildings for validation purposes. The test successfully resolved the geometric influence of architectural features based on the attenuation of muon flux in good agreement between experimental results and the simulation prediction."

2025_article_research_article_september_18_2025,"21 September 2025 14:25:36 This work presents the design and experimental evaluation of muon trigger detectors tailored for industrial-scale applications. Studies were conducted using an organic scintillator plate measuring 250  250  10 mm3 , configured with varying numbers of silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) devices, each with a detection area of 4  4 mm2 . Various reflective materials, such as reflective paint, aluminum foil, and high-gloss paper, were applied to enhance the detected scintillation photon yield. Particular attention was given to optimize dark count suppression and muon event discrimination. Four detector configurations were designed, optimized, and evaluated individually. Spatially resolved muon detection efficiency was assessed using a muon coincidence detector with an active area of 50  50 mm2 . The assembly procedures for the different detector configurations are also discussed. Finally, a trigger detector configuration incorporating a single SiPM device coupled with a wavelength-shifting fiber clamp was identified as providing the most efficient collection for scintillation photon yield. This configuration is cost-effective, modular, and easy to mass-produce, making it well-suited for the developing of large-scale muon trigger detectors for industrial applications."

An array of ground-surface detectors can reveal the secondary particles, which originate from the interaction of cosmic rays with the atmosphere. In this work, we present an investigation of the low-threshold rate (scaler) time series recorded in 16 yr of operation by the Pierre Auger Observatory surface detectors in Malargüe, Argentina. Through an advanced spectral analysis, we detected highly statistically significant variations in the time series with periods ranging from the decadal to the daily scale. We investigate their origin, revealing a direct connection with solar variability. Thanks to their intrinsic very low noise level, the Auger scalers allow a thorough and detailed investigation of the galactic cosmic-ray flux variations in the heliosphere at different timescales and can, therefore, be considered a new proxy of solar variability.

2025_article_some_interesting_observations_of_cosmic_ray_variations_durin,"Multiple interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) erupted from AR 13664 during 2024 May 8–13. On 2024 May 10, after the arrival of the ICME shock at 17:04 UT, a Forbush Decrease (FD) was seen in various Neutron Monitor (NM) stations located worldwide. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of neutron data from 28 NM stations and gamma-ray data obtained from the NaI(Tl) detector at Maitri, Antarctica. The present paper reports for the first time about an ICME shock-sheath related enhancement of ∼3%–5% magnitude in the neutron flux at stations with geomagnetic rigidity between 4 and 7 GV, located at higher altitudes (�1000 m). For these stations, the high-rigidity ends of the asymptotic trajectories are confined to the midnight to the postmidnight region. It appears that the increase may be associated with magnetospheric particle precipitation triggered by the passage of the ICME shock-sheath. The variation of FD amplitude with rigidity shows a decreasing trend in general, with a minimum amplitude at 5–7 GV, which we attribute to the location of field-aligned currents (FACs). The FD amplitude is found to have the effects of storm-time westward ring current, FACs, and magnetospheric dynamics, in addition to the ICME parameters. During the recovery phase of FD, enhancement is observed between 01:50 and 03:00 UT on 2024 May 11, which coincided with Ground Level Enhancement (GLE#74). The GLE#74 was coeval with the strong SYM-H index and the sudden recovery of the FD due to reduced interplanetary magnetic field, which might be responsible for the observed enhancement at high rigidity stations.

2025_article_the_1_june_2025_forbush_decrease_measured_over_a_rangeof_pri,"The 1 June 2025 Forbush decrease in the terrestrial ground-level flux of cosmic ray sec- ondaries was recorded by many cosmic ray systems. This was the deepest such decrease from the quiescent value of the flux, which has been observed over the past two decades. It resulted from a complex series of solar events, none of which on its own reached the most extreme level. The extreme depth of this decrease has enabled measurements of the flux reduction to be made, which would normally be severely limited by particle counting statistics. In particular, here we examine the decrease phenomenon over a primary cosmic ray energy range, which is rarely accessible due to the low flux of high energy cosmic rays. This work considers data mainly from a muon telescope system, which can respond to both unaccompanied muons and small cosmic ray air showers, providing data from GeV to mid-TeV energies, where the Forbush decrease ceases to be statistically observable. This paper examines the depth of the flux decrease, as a fraction below its quiescent value, over that primary energy range. The progressive development of internal time structure in the flux through the seven days of the phenomenon is also demonstrated."

2025_article_time_lag_analysis_of_the_space_weather_effects_on_muon_and_n,"In the present study, we collect and analyze data from four cosmic ray detectors, including two muon telescopes and two neutron monitors (NMs), installed at locations with diﬀerent geomagnetic cut-oﬀ rigidities. After applying atmospheric pressure and temperature corrections, we examine the secondary cosmic ray particle ﬂux percentage changes during an enhanced solar activity period from Febru- ary 27 to May 31, 2024, which includes the prominent G5 geomagnetic event in May 2024. This severe geomagnetic storm, during which the disturbance storm time (Dst) index reached a peak of -412nT, is of particular interest for cosmic ray research, as it results in a sub- stantial Forbush decrease (unusually large at multiple locations, e.g., with more than 10% reduction in neutron ﬂux observed at OULU NM station), highlighting how geomagnetic disturbances aﬀect cosmic ray precipitation. During the reported period, measurements from these detectors show a notable correlation with each other. Our analysis reveals a time lag of four hours between the OULU neutron monitor (leading) and both the APO and CHARA muon stations (following), and a one hour time lag between the NEWK neutron monitor (leading) and both the APO and CHARA muon stations (following). Additionally, there is a one hour time lag between the OULU and NEWK neutron monitors, with OULU leading NEWK, and a one-hour time lag between the APO and CHARA muon stations. A substantial decrease in ﬂux before and during the two geomagnetic storms (G4 on 2024–03-24 and G5 on 2024–05-10) cal- culated as transient rates of ﬂux change over intervals of 3 h, 6 h, and 12 h shows that the sharpest decrease occurs within the 6-h time window. The cross-correlation time lag analysis between cosmic rays and geomagnetic activity indices, as well as solar wind param- eters, for the period from February to May 2024, shows that cosmic rays lag by 3-5 h relative to the Dst index (which leads), and by 2-5 h relative to the solar wind speed (which also leads). Additionally, the cross-correlation analysis between cosmic ray variability (running diﬀerence) and Dst in a time window before and during the considered geomagnetic storm suggests a delay of Dst by 5–10 h with respect"

To enhance LLP discovery potential at the LHC, the ANUBIS experiment has been proposed to instrument the ceiling of the ATLAS experiment’s underground cavern with dedicated tracking detectors. This report summarises recent progress towards realising ANUBIS. Specifically, a key milestone has been achieved with the installation and commissioning of proANUBIS, a prototype that serves as a proof-of-concept for ANUBIS. We describe the proANUBIS setup, including its remotely-operated data acquisition system and automatic signal processing chain. The proANUBIS demonstrator is used to evaluate the detector performance under realistic conditions in the UX1 ATLAS experimental cavern, including readout synchronisation with the ATLAS experiment. Furthermore, proANUBIS allows for the direct measurement of relevant background processes in a representative location within the ATLAS cavern, providing input for the simulation of such processes for the future ANUBIS detector.

It is primarily targeted at undergraduates and lecturers in introductory courses in particle physics, but we anticipate that it should also be useful for school pupils and teachers studying the basics of particle physics, and perhaps also current researchers. Users may draw particle lines and link them together to form vertices and complete diagrams, and FeynCraft determines invalid vertices using a sequence of simple rules, showing users which vertices are invalid and why. Diagrams may be drawn that involve both fundamental Standard Model particles and hadrons (where hadrons are represented by their constituent quark content). Users can also be presented with a process for which they must draw valid Feynman diagrams – FeynCraft is able to generate such ‘problems’ at random, but there is also the facility to create, share, import and solve curated sets of problems. Alternatively, one is able to specify the process, and ask FeynCraft itself to generate the Feynman diagrams. Finally, we include several overlay options that give more information on a Feynman diagram (e.g. QCD colour flow, interaction strengths), and the option to export a drawn diagram as LATEX code."

2025_preprint_improving_muon_scattering_tomography_performance_with_a_muon,"Muon imaging, especially muon scattering tomography (MST), has recently garnered significant attention. MST measures the magnitude of muon scattering angles inside an object, which depends not only on the material properties but also on the muon momentum. Due to the difficulty of simultaneous measurement of momentum, it was neglected and taken as a constant in multiple MST reconstruction algorithms. Recently, an experimental measurement scheme has emerged that is feasible in engineering, but it requires many layers of detectors to approach the true momentum. From this, we proposed both an algorithm to incorporating momentum into MST, and a scheme to determine the thresholds of Cherenkov detectors. This novel scheme, termed the ""equi- percentage scheme"", sets momentum thresholds for Cherenkov detector layers based on cosmic muon momentum distribution. Results showed our approach delivers noticeable enhancement in reconstructed image quality even with only two detector layers, reaching near-saturation performance with four layers. This study proves that momentum measurement significantly enhances short-duration MST, and that substantial improvement can be achieved with relatively coarse momentum measurement using 2-4 layers of Cherenkov detectors.

2025_preprint_millimeter_resolution_cosmic_ray_imaging_via_projection_shif,"Cosmic-ray muon imaging provides a non-destructive inspection technique, yet achieving millimeter-resolution imaging within practical timeframes remains challenging. Here we introduce Projection-shifted MUon transMission tomo- grAghy (PµMA), a hybrid framework that seamlessly integrates transmission and scattering information to enable high-resolution imaging. Unlike conven- tional approaches that rely on scattering-angle measurements to locate scattering points, PµMA constructs transmission tracks by connecting hit positions in upstream and downstream detectors. The material-induced angular deflection is then projected as a detectable shift in an imaging plane. This approach allows millimeter-resolution cosmic-ray imaging with as few as two detectors, signifi- cantly increasing acceptance and usable muon events, and substantially lowering detector and electronics costs. We also present multi-detector variants that incor- porate scattering-angle selection to enhance contrast. Simulations of a 30 mm thick lead block demonstrate a knife-edge width of 1.196 mm. Experiments resolve 2 mm copper sheets within 2 days, surpassing conventional methods under matched conditions."

In this work, we report on the development of four compact scintillating fiber modules, each 100 cm long and composed of two staggered layers of 1 mm diameter fibers. The fibres are read out at one end by one-dimensional silicon photomultiplier arrays with a 2 mm pitch, coupled to Citiroc1A-based front-end electronics. The modules were characterised with cosmic-ray muons, yielding a detection efficiency above 97% and a mean spatial resolution of about 0.56 mm, with uniform response over different distances from the readout end. These results demonstrate the suitability of this detector design for compact and large-area systems in muon tomography applications."

2025_preprint_science_prospects_for_the_southern_wide_field_gamma_ray_obse,"Ground-based gamma-ray astronomy is now firmly established as a key observational approach to address critical topics at the frontiers of astroparticle physics and high-energy astrophysics. Whilst the field of TeV astronomy was once dominated by arrays of atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, ground-level particle detection has now been demonstrated to be an equally viable and strongly complementary approach. Ground-level particle detection provides continuous monitoring of the overhead sky, critical for the mapping of extended structures and capturing transient phenomena. As demonstrated by HAWC and LHAASO, the technique provides the best available sensitivity above a few tens of TeV, and for the first time access to the PeV energy range. Despite the success of this approach, there is so far no major ground-level particle-based observatory with access to the Southern sky. H.E.S.S., located in Namibia, is the only major gamma-ray instrument in the Southern Hemisphere, and has shown the extraordinary richness of the inner galaxy in the TeV band, but is limited both in terms of field of view and energy reach. SWGO, the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory, is an international effort to construct the first wide-field instrument in the south with deep sensitivity from 100s of GeV into the PeV domain. The project is now close to the end of its development phase and planning for construction of the array in Chile has begun. Here we describe the baseline design, expected sensitivity and resolution, and describe in detail the main scientific topics that will be addressed by this new facility and its initial phase SWGO-A. We show that SWGO will have a transformational impact on a wide range of topics from cosmic-ray acceleration and transport to the nature of dark matter. SWGO represents a key piece of infrastructure for multi-messenger astronomy in the next decade, with strong scientific synergies with the nearby CTA Observatory."

However, previous studies have shown that PSD performance in plastic scintillators deteriorates as the scintillator length increases, posing a significant limitation for large-area applications, such as radiation portal monitors (RPMs) used in homeland security. To address this, a systematic study was conducted using the Monte Carlo simulation toolkit Geant4. This research evaluates how variations in scintillator geometry and length, optical surface treatment, and photodetector noise impact light collection efficiency (LCE), pulse shape formation, and PSD performance. The simulations incorporate recent updates to Geant4 which enable more accurate modelling of scintillation decay components and their particle-dependent intensities, building on prior work in the field. Results show that increasing the scintillator length reduces light collection efficiency (LCE) and introduces pulse shape artefacts. These distortions deviate from the Gaussian-like appearance observed in smaller scintillators and increase susceptibility to noise, leading to degraded PSD performance in elongated detectors. While highly reflective and specular surface treatments enhance LCE, diffuse reflectors better preserve pulse shape fidelity. These findings provide new insights into the causes of PSD degradation in elongated plastic scintillators."

2026_article_https_doi_org_10_5194_egusphere_2025_6494,". This paper investigates the prevalence and identification of spurious correlations within space weather datasets, a critical concern given the complex interdependencies of nature of geophysical phenomena. This is carried out using daily- averaged galactic cosmic ray (GCR) datasets from MOSC and OULU neutron monitor (NM) stations analyzed separately, the large Forbush Decrease (FD) (FD >3%) and the small FD (FD ≤ 3%) in each stations, in other to account for the effects of 5 11-year solar cycle oscillations. For the first time, a statistical analytical method was employed to test the link between FD amplitudes and solar-geomagnetic variables in each datasets after the effects of 11-year solar cycle oscillations are filtered. We demonstrate that while significant correlations between various space weather indices and Forbush Decrease events are empiri- cally observable , a meticulous analysis reveals that a subset of these relationships may not represent true physical causality but rather arise from statistical artifacts or confounding factors inherent in the data. Specifically, analyses of Forbush Decreases 10 often reveal varying correlation coefficients with geomagnetic and solar wind parameters, which can fluctuate significantly across different time periods and cosmic ray stations . For instance, correlations between Forbush Decrease amplitudes and in- terplanetary magnetic field strength, solar wind speed, and geomagnetic indices like Kp and Dst have been observed to exhibit both negative and positive trends, depending on the specific dataset and analytical approach employed. The results obviously show inconsistent in the datasets for both MOSC and OULU stations for the large and small Fds respectively – specifically a 15 strong correlations were noticed for the parameters’ regression analyses after the effects of 11-year solar cycle oscillations were removed for both big and small Fds. These inconsistencies strongly suggest the infulence of 11-year solar cycle oscillations on the FDs counted on both stations, thereby affecting the relationships between the Fds and the geomagnetic tested variables, echoing concerns about ""spurious regression"" in the stationary time series. Most of the results are statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. The results obtained here imply that 11-year solar cycle oscillations has impacts on the GCR flux 20 intensity. Keywords.

2026_article_on_the_variability_of_the_barometric_effect_and_its_relation,"Accurate estimation of the barometric coefficient (β) is important for correcting pressure effects in soil moisture data from cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) due to the barometric effect. To evaluate estimation strategies for β, we compared analytical and empirical approaches using 71 CRNS and 46 neutron monitor (NM) stations across the United States, Europe, and globally. Our results show spatio-temporal variation in the barometric effect, with β ranging from 0.66 to 0.82 %hPa for NM and from 0.63 to 0.80 %hPa for CRNS. These coefficients exhibit higher variability than previously published semi-analytical models. In addition, we found that the analytically determined β values were systematically lower compared with empirical estimates, with stronger agreement between the two empirical methods (r ≈ 0.67) than between empirical and analytical approaches. Furthermore, NM stations produced higher β values than CRNS, indicating that differences in detector energy sensitivity affected the values of β. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) further showed that the analytical and empirical β estimates clustered together, reflecting shared sensitivity to elevation. In contrast, soil moisture and atmospheric humidity projected nearly orthogonally to the β vectors, indicating negligible influence, while cut-off rigidity contributed to a separate, inverse gradient. Analytical β estimates were fully orthogonal to AH, while empirical methods showed only slight deviations beyond orthogonality. The barometric coefficient (β), therefore, varies with location, altitude, atmospheric conditions, and sensor type, highlighting the necessity of station-specific values for precise correction. Overall, our study emphasizes the need for atmospheric correction in CRNS measurements Academic Editor: Michele Penza and introduces a method for deriving site- and sensor-specific β values for accurate soil Received: 8 December 2025 moisture estimation.

2026_article_scintillation_muon_telescope_module_with_fiber_optic_light_c,"A scintillation muon telescope module with fiber-optic light collection using silicon photomultipliers was developed, tested, and installed for continuous monitoring to study cosmic ray variations. The aim of this study was to create a scintillation muon telescope module, continuously monitor the muon component in test mode, and study the long-term stability of the detector parameters. Methods for processing the obtained data were developed. To assess the stability of the module parameters, an internal control technique was used, involving data from other detectors. The results of testing and long-term continuous monitoring showed that the stability of the developed muon detector is better than 0.1%/year, without the need for its operation in a thermostatic chamber. The study concludes that ease of operation, cost, compactness, low power consumption and stability are factors that determine the advantages of the developed module, which is an essential element for constructing a multidirectional muon telescope."
2026_article_simulation_based_analysis_of_temperature_and_barometric_effe,"As secondary cosmic-ray muons propagate through the atmosphere, their flux at ground level is influenced by variations in atmospheric parameters. The two most significant effects are the barometric effect, caused by changes in at- mospheric pressure, and the temperature effect, resulting from fluctuations in atmospheric temperature. Correcting for these effects is essential to improve the sensitivity of ground-based muon detectors to cosmic-ray variations of non-atmospheric origin. Different theoretical and empirical correction meth- ods have their own strengths and limitations, making direct comparisons using observed data challenging. One way to evaluate their performance is through simulations, where atmospheric variations are the only factors af- fecting flux changes. However, a necessary first step, and the main goal of this work, is to establish how accurately atmospheric effects are simulated. In this study, we simulated muon flux at Earth’s surface under varying atmo- spheric conditions using the CORSIKA Monte Carlo code. The properties of simulated muon count time series were compared with those of the observed data. After applying atmospheric corrections to both datasets, we concluded that the effective removal of the annual variation suggests that the temper-"

2026_preprint_ground_level_enhancement_gle_77_in_the_gamma_ray_component_f,". This article presents the observations of the extreme ground-level enhancement (GLE #77) of Solar Cycle 25 that occurred on 11 November 2025, using ground-based NaI(Tl) gamma-ray detectors deployed at Arctic and Antarctic stations, together with neutron mon- itor data and particle measurements from the GOES-18 satellite. The event was associated with an intense X-class solar flare and a strong solar energetic proton event. This paper reports the first ground-based detection of a GLE using gamma-ray detectors operating si- multaneously in both polar regions, which are concurrent with increases in neutron monitor counts. Thus highlights the capability of polar gamma-ray detectors to complement tradi- tional neutron monitor observations during extreme solar proton events. A detailed analysis revealed distinct prompt and delayed responses during the event evolution. Interestingly, the signature of the prompt peak of GLE#77 (at 10:38 UT) was observed up to high-rigidity neutron monitors (low latitudes). However, the delayed peak (at 13:08 UT) was not seen at the stations with rigidity > 6 GV. The timing of the prompt and delayed peaks coincided with the proton flux peaks observed by the GOES-18 satellite at energies > 150 MeV and 12-99 MeV, respectively. It is observed that the GLE amplitude has a strong dependence on geomagnetic cut off rigidity and has a weak solar zenith angle dependence."
2026_preprint_monitoring_the_upper_atmospheric_temperature_and_interplanet,"We study the inﬂuence of variations in the upper atmospheric temperature and interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld on the cosmic ray induced atmospheric muon ﬂux measured by the GRAPES-3 experiment over 22 years (2001–2022) of data; spanning three solar cycles: the declining phase of Solar Cycle 23, the full Cycle 24, and the rising and maximum phases of Cycle 25. Located in Ooty- India, the GRAPES-3 large area (560 m2 ) muon telescope detects ∼4 billion muons daily above 1 GeV, with an angular resolution of ∼4◦ , enabling a statistical precision <0.01% on the hourly muon rate. After accounting for the eﬀect of atmospheric pressure variations, we compare this data with the upper atmospheric temperature inferred from NASAs MERRA-2 dataset as well as magnetic ﬁeld data from the ACE and WIND spacecraft at Lagrange point L1. A simultaneous iterative ﬁtting method employing Fast Fourier Transforms and a narrow band-pass ﬁlter reveals the temperature and magnetic ﬁeld coeﬃcients to be αT = − 0.2241 ± 0.0003 (stat.) ± 0.0220 (syst.) % K−1 and γM = − 0.574 ± 0.027 (stat.) ± 0.011 (syst.) % nT−1 , respectively, for an assumed hadronic attenuation length λ=120 g cm−2 , underscoring the potential of the GRAPES-3 muon telescope to serve as a real time monitor of the upper atmospheric temperature or interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld.

2026_thesis_atmospheric_muon_flux_study_with_gem_detectors,"The development of stable detection systems with high spatial resolution and efficiency for cosmic-ray telescopes constitutes a central problem in the field of muography. The High Energy Physics Group at the Universidad de los Andes (UAHEPG), Colombia, is currently investigating hodoscopes based on technologies employing scintillator bars cou- pled to Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) and gaseous detectors. This work presents a hodoscope prototype based on Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) de- tectors and a plastic scintillator trigger system, designed to measure the angular distri- bution of the atmospheric muon flux. The setup employs the VMM3a front-end readout Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) and the Scalable Readout System (SRS), together with the reconstruction and calibration algorithms developed by the RD51 Col- laboration at CERN, to simultaneously acquire signals from the external trigger and from the 1024 channels of the 10 × 10 cm2 active area triple GEM detectors. Within the scope of this work, the readout system was characterized and its optimal oper- ational parameters were determined experimentally, adapting them to the requirements of the hodoscope. Alternative powering methods for the VMM3a were implemented, achiev- ing muon detection efficiencies of up to 90%. An external trigger system based on Nuclear Instrumentation Module (NIM) modules was integrated. In collaboration with the Micromechanics Laboratory of the physics departament, a mod- ular structure was designed, allowing for the controlled variation of the distance between GEM planes, thus facilitating the measurement of angular dependencies. The performance of the hodoscope was evaluated through measurements of vertical and multi-directional muons, both in the laboratory and in field of open sky. Measurements demonstrated a temporal resolution of 9.9(4) ns for the detection system and confirmed its capability for detecting and reconstructing muon tracks under different GEM detector gain regimes. The angular distributions of the muon flux and the charge deposited in the detectors were determined, with corrections for acceptance and efficiency. Despite the Clock and Trigger Fanout (CTF) card instabilities, preliminary results con- firm that the prototype constitutes a viable system for the reconstruction of atmospheric muon tracks. Furthermore, these results represent a significant advancement in under- standing and optimizing the SRS readout system, which, due to its scalability and con- tinuous operation capability, can be extended to telescopes based on other multichannel detection technologies beyond Micro-Pattern Gaseous Detectors (MPGD)s.
