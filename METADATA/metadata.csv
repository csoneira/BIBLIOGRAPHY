Cane,,"cosmic-rays, forbush, scintillators, space-weather",1,,2026-01-13,". Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are plasma eruptions from the solar atmosphere involving previously closed field regions which are expelled into the interplanetary medium. Such regions, and the shocks which they may generate, have pronounced effects on cosmic ray densities both locally and at some distance away. These energetic particle effects can often be used to identify CMEs in the interplanetary medium, where they are usually called ‘ejecta’. When both the ejecta and shock effects are present the resulting cosmic ray event is called a ‘classical, two-step’ Forbush decrease. This paper will summarize the characteristics of CMEs, their effects on particles and the present understanding of the mechanisms involved which cause the particle effects. The role of CMEs in long term modulation will also be discussed.",

2000_article_muon-observations,PDFs/2000_article_muon-observations.pdf,article,Muon Observations,Space Science Reviews,2000,,Marc L. Duldig,,"atmospheric, cosmic-rays, detectors, forbush, scintillators, space-weather",1,,2026-01-13,". Muon observations are complementary to neutron monitor observations but there are some important differences in the two techniques. Unlike neutron monitors, muon telescope systems use coincidence techniques to obtain directional information about the arriving particle. Neutron monitor observations require simple corrections for pressure variations to compensate for the varying mass of atmospheric absorber over a site. In contrast, muon observations require additional corrections for the positive and negative temperature effects. Muon observations commenced many years before neutron monitors were constructed. Thus, muon data over a larger number of solar cycles is available to study solar modulation on anisotropies and other cosmic ray variations. The solar diurnal and semi-diurnal variations have been studied for many years. Using the tech- niques of Bieber and Chen it has been possible to derive the radial gradient, parallel mean-free path and symmetric latitude gradient of cosmic rays for rigidities <200 GV. The radial gradient varies with the 11-year solar activity cycle whereas the parallel mean-free path appears to vary with the 22- year solar magnetic cycle. The symmetric latitudinal gradient reverses at each solar polarity reversal. These results are in general agreement with predictions from modulation models. In undertaking these analyses the ratio of the parallel to perpendicular mean-free path must be assumed. There is strong contention in the literature about the correct value to employ but the results are sufficiently robust for this to be, at most, a minor problem. An asymmetric latitude gradient of highly variable nature has been found. These observations do not support current modulation models. Our view of the sidereal variation has undergone a revolution in recent times. Nagashima, Fuji- moto and Jacklyn proposed a narrow Tail-In source anisotropy and separate Loss-Cone anisotropy as being responsible for the observed variations. A new analysis technique, more amenable to such structures, was developed by Japanese and Australian researchers. They confirmed the existence of the two anisotropies. However, they found that the Tail-In anisotropy is asymmetric and that both anisotropies had different positions from the prediction. Most 27-day modulations are observed at neutron monitor rigidities but not so readily at higher rigidities. An exception to this is the Isotropic Intensity Wave modulation observed in the early 1980s and again in 1991. This modulation is very strongly related to the heliospheric sector structure and implies a significantly different cosmic ray density on either side of the neutral sheet. The interpretation of most cosmic ray modulation phenomena requires good latitude coverage in both hemispheres. The closure of many muon observatories is a matter of concern. In the northern hemisphere a few new instruments are being constructed and spatial coverage is barely adequate. In the southern hemisphere the situation is far worse with the possibility that within a decade only the Mawson observatory in Antarctica will still be in operation.",

It consists of two 100x100 mm2 THGEM electrodes in cascade, coupled to a resistive anode. The event location is recorded with a 2D double-sided readout electrode equipped with discrete delay-lines and dedicated electronics. The THGEM electrodes, produced by standard printed-circuit board and mechanical drilling techniques, a 0.4 mm thick with 0.5 mm diameter holes spaced by 1 mm. Localization resolutions of about 0.7 mm (FWHM) were measured with soft x-rays, in a detector operated with atmospheric-pressure Ar/CH4; good linearity and homogeneity were achieved. We describe the imaging-detector layout, the resistive-anode 2D readout system and the imaging properties. The THGEM has numerous potential applications that require large-area imaging detectors, with high-rate capability, single-electron sensitivity and moderate (sub-mm) localization resolution.",

Webb; Timothy A. Howard,,"atmospheric, cosmic-rays, detectors, forbush, scintillators, space-weather",,,2026-01-13,"Solar eruptive phenomena embrace a variety of eruptions, including flares, solar energetic particles, and radio bursts. Since the vast majority of these are associated with the eruption, development, and evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), we focus on CME observations in this review. CMEs are a key aspect of coronal and interplanetary dynamics. They inject large quantities of mass and magnetic flux into the heliosphere, causing major transient dis- turbances. CMEs can drive interplanetary shocks, a key source of solar energetic particles and are known to be the major contributor to severe space weather at the Earth. Studies over the past decade using the data sets from (among others) the SOHO, TRACE, Wind, ACE, STEREO, and SDO spacecraft, along with ground-based instruments, have improved our knowledge of the origins and development of CMEs at the Sun and how they contribute to space weather at Earth. SOHO, launched in 1995, has provided us with almost continuous coverage of the solar corona over more than a complete solar cycle, and the heliospheric im- agers SMEI (2003 – 2011) and the HIs (operating since early 2007) have provided us with the capability to image and track CMEs continually across the inner heliosphere. We review some key coronal properties of CMEs, their source regions and their propagation through the solar wind. The LASCO coronagraphs routinely observe CMEs launched along the Sun-Earth line as halo-like brightenings. STEREO also permits observing Earth-directed CMEs from three different viewpoints of increasing azimuthal separation, thereby enabling the estimation of their three-dimensional properties. These are important not only for space weather prediction purposes, but also for understanding the development and internal structure of CMEs since we view their source regions on the solar disk and can measure their in-situ characteristics along their axes. Included in our discussion of the recent developments in CME-related phenomena are the latest developments from the STEREO and LASCO coronagraphs and the SMEI and HI heliospheric imagers.",

Nonetheless, this momentum opportunely brings up the prospect of a fully time-based DOI estimation since fast timing signals intrinsically carry DOI information, even with a traditional single- ended readout. Consequently, extracting features of the detected signal time distribution could uncover the spatial origin of the interaction and in return, provide enhancement on the timing precision of detectors. We demonstrate the validity of a time-based DOI estimation concept in two steps. First, experimental measurements were carried out with current LSO:Ce:Ca crystals coupled to FBK NUV-HD SiPMs read out by fast high-frequency electronics to provide new evidence of a distinct DOI effect on CTR not observable before with slower electronics. Using this detector, a DOI discrimination using a double-threshold scheme on the analog timing signal together with the signal intensity information was also developed without any complex readout or detector modiﬁcation. As a second step, we explored by simulation the anticipated performance requirements of future detectors to efﬁciently estimate the DOI and we proposed four estimators that exploit either more generic or more precise features of the DOI-dependent timestamp distribution. A simple estimator using the time difference between two timestamps provided enhanced CTR. Additional improvements were achieved with estimators using multiple timestamps (e.g. kernel density estimation and neural network) converging to the Cramér–Rao lower bound developed in this work for a time-based DOI estimation. This two-step study provides insights on current and future possibilities in exploiting the timing signal features for DOI estimation aiming at ultra-fast CTR while maintaining detection efﬁciency for TOF PET.",

Blanco; P. Fonte; L. Lopes; M. Pimenta,,"atmospheric, cosmic-rays, detectors, rpc, scintillators",,,2026-01-13,"The phase-out of hydro-fluorocarbons, due to their high Global Warming Power, affecting the main gas used in Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs), tetrafluoroethane C2 H2 F4 , has increased pressure on existing systems and imposes strong restrictions on its use in new systems. This has motivated the beginning of a new line of R&D on sealed RPCs, RPCs that do not require a continuous gas flow for their operation and dispense the use of very complex and expensive re-circulation and/or recycling gas systems. At the moment it is not clear whether this solution can cover all fields of application normally allocated to RPCs, but it seems that it could be considered as a valid option for low flux triggering/tracking of particles, e.g. in cosmic ray or rare event experiments. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of a small telescope for atmospheric muon tracking consisting of four 300 x 300 mm2 sealed RPCs with gas gap widths of 1 mm, 1.5 mm and 2 mm. The results suggest that it is possible to operate this type of detectors for extended periods of time (more than five months) with its main characteristics mainly: efficiency, average charge and streamer probability, without apparent degradation and similar to a RPC operated in continuous gas flow.",

Gaunt; Adam Owen,,"neutrino, scintillators",,,2026-01-13,"FeynCraft is a browser-based game that is designed to teach players the particle interactions of the Standard Model of particle physics, and how to link these interactions together to produce valid Feynman diagrams. It is primarily targeted at undergraduates and lecturers in introductory courses in particle physics, but we anticipate that it should also be useful for school pupils and teachers studying the basics of particle physics, and perhaps also current researchers. Users may draw particle lines and link them together to form vertices and complete diagrams, and FeynCraft determines invalid vertices using a sequence of simple rules, showing users which vertices are invalid and why. Diagrams may be drawn that involve both fundamental Standard Model particles and hadrons (where hadrons are represented by their constituent quark content). Users can also be presented with a process for which they must draw valid Feynman diagrams – FeynCraft is able to generate such ‘problems’ at random, but there is also the facility to create, share, import and solve curated sets of problems. Alternatively, one is able to specify the process, and ask FeynCraft itself to generate the Feynman diagrams. Finally, we include several overlay options that give more information on a Feynman diagram (e.g. QCD colour flow, interaction strengths), and the option to export a drawn diagram as LATEX code.",

The aim was to create a module for continuous muon monitoring and study long-term detector stability; methods for processing the data were developed. An internal control technique using data from other detectors was used to assess stability. Results show stability better than 0.1%/year without a thermostatic chamber, with advantages in ease of operation, cost, compactness, low power consumption, and stability for a multidirectional muon telescope.",
