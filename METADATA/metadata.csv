Nonetheless, this momentum opportunely brings up the prospect of a fully time-based DOI estimation since fast timing signals intrinsically carry DOI information, even with a traditional single- ended readout. Consequently, extracting features of the detected signal time distribution could uncover the spatial origin of the interaction and in return, provide enhancement on the timing precision of detectors. We demonstrate the validity of a time-based DOI estimation concept in two steps. First, experimental measurements were carried out with current LSO:Ce:Ca crystals coupled to FBK NUV-HD SiPMs read out by fast high-frequency electronics to provide new evidence of a distinct DOI effect on CTR not observable before with slower electronics. Using this detector, a DOI discrimination using a double-threshold scheme on the analog timing signal together with the signal intensity information was also developed without any complex readout or detector modiﬁcation. As a second step, we explored by simulation the anticipated performance requirements of future detectors to efﬁciently estimate the DOI and we proposed four estimators that exploit either more generic or more precise features of the DOI-dependent timestamp distribution. A simple estimator using the time difference between two timestamps provided enhanced CTR. Additional improvements were achieved with estimators using multiple timestamps (e.g. kernel density estimation and neural network) converging to the Cramér–Rao lower bound developed in this work for a time-based DOI estimation. This two-step study provides insights on current and future possibilities in exploiting the timing signal features for DOI estimation aiming at ultra-fast CTR while maintaining detection efﬁciency for TOF PET.",

Anekwe; C.I. Onah,,,,2026-01-13,"Forbush decreases (FDs) are short-term reductions in the time-intensity flux of cosmic rays (CRs). Their spectacular and unpredictable intensity variations present their detection, timing, magnitude estimation, and cataloging as one of the most difficult tasks in space weather research. Due to the paucity of accurate event lists, new methods of event detection and FD catalogs continue to appear in the literature. But validation of either the old or new lists remains an open field. This work intends to remind the astrophysicist and space weather community that dramatic modifications of the age-long manual/semi- manual FD event cataloging are long overdue. In this present era of extremely fast and sophisticated computer algorithms, a complementary automated list of all the manually created FD catalogs, especially the IZMIRAN (Pushkin Institute of Terres- trial Magnetism, Ionosphere, and Radio Wave Propagation, Russian Academy of Sciences, http://spaceweather.izmiran.ru/ eng/dbs.html) (which is the currently available and widely used lists) should have been developed, the old lists expanded and new catalogs created. A Fourier decomposition technique, which guarantees the sinusoidal fidelity of the input and output signals, is presented. This highlights the possibility of a complete algorithm-based FD cataloging with the aim of stimulating other automated methodological approaches. The impossibility of creating accurate FD lists without first disentangling the contribution from diurnal CR anisotropy and the 11-year solar oscillation was qualitatively analyzed. Using a set of CR data from Moscow station, we automatically created four different FD catalogs − FD1 from the raw data without adjusting for the contribution from the 11-year solar cycle oscillation or CR anisotropy, FD2 after adjusting for the 11-year solar cycle effects, FD3 after adjusting for CR anisotropy and FD4 after adjusting for both the 11-year and CR anisotropy. This allows us to practically demonstrate the possible discrepancies among different FD catalogs and the attendant bias implications on FD-based space weather investigation. Given the detailed analyses performed, FD4 is the most accurate FD list. This serves as an evidence that accurate FD catalog is realizable. We also establish that several of the events in FD1, FD2 and FD3 catalogs may be intensity reductions/spurious events arising from other CR phenomena like anisotropies.",

The sRPC detector is a supplementary detector for the SND@LHC experiment. It is a sealed Resis- tive Plate Chamber detector, which presents advantages over standard RPC detectors in operation reliability and environmental impact due to its ability to operate without gas flow. The detector was installed with the main purpose of calculating the flux of the important muon background created at the ATLAS experiment, so as to improve detection of neutrinos at SND@LHC. We have utilized data from a run of the LHC to obtain the muon flux, which is found to be 1.01 × 105 for an area of 30 × 21 cm2 , and 6.39 × 104 for an area of 30 × 30 cm2 . We have also utilized a Monte Carlo simulation as a model for the flux, obtaining deviations from the real result between 60% and 120%, and concluding that the simulated flux values were overestimated.",

Additionally, they constitute a significant background for many underground and deep-sea neutrino experiments, such as TRopIcal DEep-sea Neutrino Telescope (TRIDENT). Understanding the muon flux at various depths in the deep sea is essential for validating TRIDENT simulations and guiding the development of optimized trigger strategies. This paper introduces a novel device based on plastic scintillators and silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) named MuonSLab, which is designed to measure muon flux in the deep sea and has the potential to be extended to other atmospheric muon property measurements. We discuss the design and instrumentation of MuonSLab and present results from several muon flux measurements, demonstrating its sensitivity to muon detection and its stability during operations across multiple locations.",

As the financial and labor costs of muography detector development hinder their massive applications, we develop a novel muon detector called MuGrid by coupling a monolithic plastic scintillator with a light guide array in order to achieve com- petitive spatial resolution while substantially reducing production costs. For a prototype detector in 30  30 cm2 , the intrinsic spatial resolu- tion has been optimized toward a millimeter scale. An outdoor field muography experiment was conducted to monitor two buildings for validation purposes. The test successfully resolved the geometric influence of architectural features based on the attenuation of muon flux in good agreement between experimental results and the simulation prediction.",

This was the deepest such decrease from the quiescent value of the flux, which has been observed over the past two decades. It resulted from a complex series of solar events, none of which on its own reached the most extreme level. The extreme depth of this decrease has enabled measurements of the flux reduction to be made, which would normally be severely limited by particle counting statistics. In particular, here we examine the decrease phenomenon over a primary cosmic ray energy range, which is rarely accessible due to the low flux of high energy cosmic rays. This work considers data mainly from a muon telescope system, which can respond to both unaccompanied muons and small cosmic ray air showers, providing data from GeV to mid-TeV energies, where the Forbush decrease ceases to be statistically observable. This paper examines the depth of the flux decrease, as a fraction below its quiescent value, over that primary energy range. The progressive development of internal time structure in the flux through the seven days of the phenomenon is also demonstrated.",

To enhance LLP discovery potential at the LHC, the ANUBIS experiment has been proposed to instrument the ceiling of the ATLAS experiment’s underground cavern with dedicated tracking detectors. This report summarises recent progress towards realising ANUBIS. Specifically, a key milestone has been achieved with the installation and commissioning of proANUBIS, a prototype that serves as a proof-of-concept for ANUBIS. We describe the proANUBIS setup, including its remotely-operated data acquisition system and automatic signal processing chain. The proANUBIS demonstrator is used to evaluate the detector performance under realistic conditions in the UX1 ATLAS experimental cavern, including readout synchronisation with the ATLAS experiment. Furthermore, proANUBIS allows for the direct measurement of relevant background processes in a representative location within the ATLAS cavern, providing input for the simulation of such processes for the future ANUBIS detector. The paper concludes with an update on the current status of the ANUBIS project and its roadmap toward a full-scale implementation in the ATLAS cavern. December 23, 2025",

Here we introduce Projection-shifted MUon transMission tomo- grAghy (PµMA), a hybrid framework that seamlessly integrates transmission and scattering information to enable high-resolution imaging. Unlike conven- tional approaches that rely on scattering-angle measurements to locate scattering points, PµMA constructs transmission tracks by connecting hit positions in upstream and downstream detectors. The material-induced angular deflection is then projected as a detectable shift in an imaging plane. This approach allows millimeter-resolution cosmic-ray imaging with as few as two detectors, signifi- cantly increasing acceptance and usable muon events, and substantially lowering detector and electronics costs. We also present multi-detector variants that incor- porate scattering-angle selection to enhance contrast. Simulations of a 30 mm thick lead block demonstrate a knife-edge width of 1.196 mm. Experiments resolve 2 mm copper sheets within 2 days, surpassing conventional methods under matched conditions.",

Plastic scintillators provide a cost-effective and physically robust alternative to conventional neutron detection technologies, such as 3 He detectors, liquid scintillators, and crystal scintillators. However, previous studies have shown that PSD performance in plastic scintillators deteriorates as the scintillator length increases, posing a significant limitation for large-area applications, such as radiation portal monitors (RPMs) used in homeland security. To address this, a systematic study was conducted using the Monte Carlo simulation toolkit Geant4. This research evaluates how variations in scintillator geometry and length, optical surface treatment, and photodetector noise impact light collection efficiency (LCE), pulse shape formation, and PSD performance. The simulations incorporate recent updates to Geant4 which enable more accurate modelling of scintillation decay components and their particle-dependent intensities, building on prior work in the field. Results show that increasing the scintillator length reduces light collection efficiency (LCE) and introduces pulse shape artefacts. These distortions deviate from the Gaussian-like appearance observed in smaller scintillators and increase susceptibility to noise, leading to degraded PSD performance in elongated detectors. While highly reflective and specular surface treatments enhance LCE, diffuse reflectors better preserve pulse shape fidelity. These findings provide new insights into the causes of PSD degradation in elongated plastic scintillators.",

The Radiation Sensitivity and Cumulative Sensitivity have also been calculated, assuming a zenith angle attenuation of the form I0 = Io .coszO for cosmic ray intensity. I.   INTRODUCTION MEASUREMENTS of cosmlc ray intensity in the vertical direction ate most]y carried out by Geiger counter telescopes which comprise of a series of counter trays of rectangular dimensions situated one above the other. All counters in the same tray ate connected in paralM and the pulses from the various trays are red to a coincidence unit which gives a sizable pulse in the output only if pulses are fed to all its inputs within a small time interval, termed as the ""resolving t i m e "" of the coincidence unit. The coincidence output rate corresponds to single charged particles passing through all the counter trays except for (1) a contribution due to showers where different trays could be triggered by different particles all belonging to the same shower and hence arriving almost simultaneously and (2) a contribution due to chance coin- cidences where different trays could be triggered by different particles appa- rently unrelated to each other. For coincidence units with resolving times of the order of a few microseconds as is usually the case and for more than two counter trays in coincidence, the contribution of chance coincidences is negligible. The contribution of side showers depends on the material in the near environment of the telescope and on the separation of the trays. Under optimum conditions this does not exceed about 7 ~ for triple coinci- dence telescopes, as investigated by Greisen and Nereson. 1 Thus the vast majority of counts registered by such a counter telescope are due to cosmic radiation incident in the cone within which a single particle can cross aH the trays. 3O",

A. Shea , D. F. Smart , K. G. McCracken",,,,2026-01-13,". Using sixth degreesimulationsof the quiescentgeomagneticfield, we have stud- ied the vertical cutoff rigidities of more than three hundredpositionson the earth's surface. Twenty-six of these positionsare near the South African magnetic anomaly, and six other points are in a region of the North Atlantic where Pomerantz and Agarwal have reported anomalousresults. The cutoff rigidities have been obtained by detailed computation of the trajectoriesof cosmicraysat 0.01-byrigidity intervalsto allow for the effectsof the penumbra. Differencesgreater than 15% from the Quenby and Wenk threshold values have been found in the vicinity of South Africa, the South Atlantic, and the Canary Islands.Various latitude surveys are shown to exhibit consistencywhen plotted against the cutoff rigidities determined by this computationalmethod. It is concludedthat, though there is essentiallyno difference between the cutoff rigidities obtained using two currently acceptedfield models,these simula- tions of the geomagneticfield are not completely adequate over some parts of the earth to describe the cosmic-rayeffects in their entirety. Cutoff rigidities for a number of neutron monitors are listed.",

The experimental observations of Forbush decreases in recent years are reviewed and related to different theoretical models which have been proposed. The observational data from both ground-based and spacecraft experiments were selected to illustrate the important charac- teristics of Forbush decreases. The form of the rigidity dependence of the cosmic-ray modulation during the decreases and effects of the geomagnetic field upon the magnitude of the decreases are discussed. Recent results to deduce the cosmic-ray flow patterns from the observed anisotropies during the decreases are presented. Other features such as differences in onset times, recovery times, precursory increases are discussed. In considering the theoretical models particular emphasis is placed upon the agreement of the predictions of the model with the experimental observations. A theoretical model is suggested which is not original but represents a synthesis of several models previously proposed. Future important measurements and analyses necessary to an understanding of Forbush decreases are outlined.",

The differential and integral spectra of muons moving in the near-vertical direction have been measured at Nottingham using a solid iron magnet spectrometer. This instrument utilised an automatic recording system for data collection which allowed the range of muon momenta covered by this investigation to extend from 4 to 3000 GeV/c. the lower limit being set by the magnet itself. The diffusion model for particle propagation through the Earth’s atmosphere was used to provide the muon momentum spectrum incident upon the instrument. A comparison of this spectrum, after modification by scattering and errors in the determination of the angular deflection, with the measured spectrum allowed a value of -2.72 i 0.0 1 to be assigned to the exponent of the primary spectrum. If a contribution to the sea-level muon flux from the decay of K mesons is included then better agreement between the theoretical and experimental spectra is obtained for a value of the exponent of -2.73 together with a K/n ratio at production of 0.087. However, when the muon momentum range is reduced to 28-3000 GeV/c the comparison between the measured and the theoretical spectra shows agreement for an exponent of -2.60 + 0.01 for 100% n-meson parentage. Further, the inclusion of K-meson decay in this case is inconclusive since it does not allow any sensible values to be assigned to the exponent or the contribution provided by this process.",

2000_article_muon-observations,PDFs/2000_article_muon-observations.pdf,article,Muon Observations,PoS,2000,,,,,,2026-01-13,". Muon observations are complementary to neutron monitor observations but there are some important differences in the two techniques. Unlike neutron monitors, muon telescope systems use coincidence techniques to obtain directional information about the arriving particle. Neutron monitor observations require simple corrections for pressure variations to compensate for the varying mass of atmospheric absorber over a site. In contrast, muon observations require additional corrections for the positive and negative temperature effects. Muon observations commenced many years before neutron monitors were constructed. Thus, muon data over a larger number of solar cycles is available to study solar modulation on anisotropies and other cosmic ray variations. The solar diurnal and semi-diurnal variations have been studied for many years. Using the tech- niques of Bieber and Chen it has been possible to derive the radial gradient, parallel mean-free path and symmetric latitude gradient of cosmic rays for rigidities <200 GV. The radial gradient varies with the 11-year solar activity cycle whereas the parallel mean-free path appears to vary with the 22- year solar magnetic cycle. The symmetric latitudinal gradient reverses at each solar polarity reversal. These results are in general agreement with predictions from modulation models. In undertaking these analyses the ratio of the parallel to perpendicular mean-free path must be assumed. There is strong contention in the literature about the correct value to employ but the results are sufficiently robust for this to be, at most, a minor problem. An asymmetric latitude gradient of highly variable nature has been found. These observations do not support current modulation models. Our view of the sidereal variation has undergone a revolution in recent times. Nagashima, Fuji- moto and Jacklyn proposed a narrow Tail-In source anisotropy and separate Loss-Cone anisotropy as being responsible for the observed variations. A new analysis technique, more amenable to such structures, was developed by Japanese and Australian researchers. They confirmed the existence of the two anisotropies. However, they found that the Tail-In anisotropy is asymmetric and that both anisotropies had different positions from the prediction. Most 27-day modulations are observed at neutron monitor rigidities but not so readily at higher rigidities. An exception to this is the Isotropic Intensity Wave modulation observed in the early 1980s and again in 1991. This modulation is very strongly related to the heliospheric sector structure and implies a significantly different cosmic ray density on either side of the neutral sheet. The interpretation of most cosmic ray modulation phenomena requires good latitude coverage in both hemispheres. The closure of many muon observatories is a matter of concern. In the northern hemisphere a few new instruments are being constructed and spatial coverage is barely adequate. In the southern hemisphere the situation is far worse with the possibility that within a decade only the Mawson observatory in Antarctica will still be in operation.",

Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are plasma eruptions from the solar atmosphere involving previously closed field regions which are expelled into the interplanetary medium. Such regions, and the shocks which they may generate, have pronounced effects on cosmic ray densities both locally and at some distance away. These energetic particle effects can often be used to identify CMEs in the interplanetary medium, where they are usually called ‘ejecta’. When both the ejecta and shock effects are present the resulting cosmic ray event is called a ‘classical, two-step’ Forbush decrease. This paper will summarize the characteristics of CMEs, their effects on particles and the present understanding of the mechanisms involved which cause the particle effects. The role of CMEs in long term modulation will also be discussed.",

Under an agreement on scientific cooperation between Brazil and Japan, a prototype detector of cosmic ray muons has been operating since March 2001 at Southern Space Observatory (SSO) located at São Martinho da Serra (29◦ S, 53◦ W), Brazil, in order to observe cosmic ray precursors of geomagnetic storms. This detector plays a key roll in the prototype network of muon observations together with two larger detectors operating in Japan and Australia. The planned extension of the detector in its size will complete the global coverage of our muon detector network. The prototype network has already discovered cosmic ray precursors of several magnetic storms, as reported by Munakata et al. (Munakata, K. et al.: 2000, J Geophys Res. 105, A12, pp. 27, 457–27, 468; Munakata K. et al.: 2001, Proceedings of ICRC.) We have also observed the Forbush Decreases (FDs), as well as the precursory enhancements of cosmic ray anisotropy preceding the onsets of geomagnetic storms. This report presents the description of the network and some results obtained since the prototype detector implementation.",

The setup consists of two long scintillator counters with double-ended readout. Previous measurements have shown that the intensity of muons obey the cos 2 0 distribution. In this thesis, two methods are used. The first method is by rotating the whole setup to point at the zenith angle un- der measurement. The second method is by time of flight measurement. With the double-ended readout, the position of the muon pass through can be reconstructed from the time difference between the two ends. Therefore, the paths of muons can be 2 also reconstructed.

Howard,,,,2026-01-13,"Solar eruptive phenomena embrace a variety of eruptions, including flares, solar energetic particles, and radio bursts. Since the vast majority of these are associated with the eruption, development, and evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), we focus on CME observations in this review. CMEs are a key aspect of coronal and interplanetary dynamics. They inject large quantities of mass and magnetic flux into the heliosphere, causing major transient dis- turbances. CMEs can drive interplanetary shocks, a key source of solar energetic particles and are known to be the major contributor to severe space weather at the Earth. Studies over the past decade using the data sets from (among others) the SOHO, TRACE, Wind, ACE, STEREO, and SDO spacecraft, along with ground-based instruments, have improved our knowledge of the origins and development of CMEs at the Sun and how they contribute to space weather at Earth. SOHO, launched in 1995, has provided us with almost continuous coverage of the solar corona over more than a complete solar cycle, and the heliospheric im- agers SMEI (2003 – 2011) and the HIs (operating since early 2007) have provided us with the capability to image and track CMEs continually across the inner heliosphere. We review some key coronal properties of CMEs, their source regions and their propagation through the solar wind. The LASCO coronagraphs routinely observe CMEs launched along the Sun-Earth line as halo-like brightenings. STEREO also permits observing Earth-directed CMEs from three different viewpoints of increasing azimuthal separation, thereby enabling the estimation of their three-dimensional properties. These are important not only for space weather prediction purposes, but also for understanding the development and internal structure of CMEs since we view their source regions on the solar disk and can measure their in-situ characteristics along their axes. Included in our discussion of the recent developments in CME-related phenomena are the latest developments from the STEREO and LASCO coronagraphs and the SMEI and HI heliospheric imagers.",

The discovery of extensive air showers by Rossi, Schmeiser, Bothe, Kohlhörster and Auger at the end of the 1930s, facilitated by the coincidence technique of Bothe and Rossi, led to fundamental con- tributions in the ﬁeld of cosmic ray physics and laid the foundation for high-energy particle physics. Soon after World War II a cosmic ray group at MIT in the USA pioneered detailed investigations of air shower phenomena and their experimental skill laid the foundation for many of the methods and much of the instrumentation used today. Soon in- terests focussed on the highest energies requiring much larger detectors to be operated. The ﬁrst detection of air ﬂuorescence light by Japanese and US groups in the early 1970s marked an important experimental breakthrough towards this end as it allowed huge volumes of atmo- sphere to be monitored by optical telescopes. Radio observations of air showers, pioneered in the 1960s, are presently experiencing a renais- sance and may revolutionise the ﬁeld again. In the last 7 decades the research has seen many ups but also a few downs. However, the exam- ple of the Cygnus X-3 story demonstrated that even non-conﬁrmable observations can have a huge impact by boosting new instrumentation to make discoveries and shape an entire scientiﬁc community.",

The geomagnetic field (Bgeo) sets a lower cutoff rigidity (RC) to the entry of cosmic particles to Earth which depends on the geomagnetic activity. From numerical simulations of the trajectory of a proton using different models for Bgeo (performed with the MAGCOS code), we use backtracking to analyze particles arriving at the location of two nodes of the net LAGO (Large Aperture Gamma ray burst Observatory) that will be built in the near future: Buenos Aires and Marambio (Antarctica), Argentina. We determine the asymptotic trajectories and the values of RC for different incidence directions, for each node. Simulations were done using several models for Bgeo that emulate different geomagnetic conditions. The presented results will help to make analysis of future observations of the flux of cosmic rays done at these two LAGO nodes.",

Fifty- nine ICMEs have been studied, but only 25 % of them were associated to a FD. We find that shock-driving magnetic clouds (MCs) produce deeper FDs than shock-driving ejecta. This fact can be explained regarding the observed growing trends between decreases in neutron monitor (NM) count rate and MC/ejecta speed and its associated rigidity. MCs are faster and have higher associated rigidities than ejecta. Also the deceleration of ICMEs seems to be a cause for producing FDs, as can be inferred from the decreasing trend between NM count rate and deceleration. This probably implies that the interaction between the ICME traveling from the corona to the Earth and the solar wind can play an important role in producing deeper FDs. Finally, we conclude that ejecta without flux rope topology are the ones less effective in unchaining FDs.",

Based on a combination of multiresolution wavelet decompositions with neural networks, we propose a method of approximation of the cosmic ray time course and the allocation of anomalous variations (Forbush effects) that occur during periods of high solar activity. During the realization of the method, an algorithm was created for selecting the level of the wavelet decomposition and adaptive construction of the neural network. By using the proposed methods, we performed a joint analysis of the geomagnetic field and cosmic rays during periods of strong magnetic storms. The strongest geomagnetic field perturbations were observed in periods of abnormal changes in cosmic ray level. Assessment of the intensity of geomagnetic disturbances on the eve of and during magnetic storm development allowed us to highlight local increases in intensity of the geomagnetic field occurring at different frequency ranges prior to the development of the storm’s main phase. Implementation of the proposed method with theoretical tools in combination with other methods will improve the estimation accuracy of the geomagnetic field state during space weather forecasting.",

R. S. de Mendonça,,,,2026-01-13,"The analysis of cosmic ray intensity variation seen by muon detectors at Earthʼs surface can help us to understand astrophysical, solar, interplanetary and geomagnetic phenomena. However, before comparing cosmic ray intensity variations with extraterrestrial phenomena, it is necessary to take into account atmospheric effects such as the temperature effect. In this work, we analyzed this effect on the Global Muon Detector Network (GMDN), which is composed of four ground-based detectors, two in the northern hemisphere and two in the southern hemisphere. In general, we found a higher temperature inﬂuence on detectors located in the northern hemisphere. Besides that, we noticed that the seasonal temperature variation observed at the ground and at the altitude of maximum muon production are in antiphase for all GMDN locations (low-latitude regions). In this way, contrary to what is expected in high-latitude regions, the ground muon intensity decrease occurring during summertime would be related to both parts of the temperature effect (the negative and the positive). We analyzed several methods to describe the temperature effect on cosmic ray intensity. We found that the mass weighted method is the one that best reproduces the seasonal cosmic ray variation observed by the GMDN detectors and allows the highest correlation with long-term variation of the cosmic ray intensity seen by neutron monitors.

IceCube is a cubic-kilometer Cherenkov detector in the deep ice at the geographic South Pole. The dominant event yield is produced by penetrating atmospheric muons with energies above several 100 GeV. Due to its large detector volume, IceCube provides unique opportunities to study atmospheric muons with large statistics in detail. Measurements of the energy spectrum and the lateral separation distribution of muons offer insights into hadronic interactions during the air shower development and can be used to test hadronic models. We will present an overview of various measurements of atmospheric muons in IceCube, including the energy spectrum of muons between 10 TeV and 1 PeV. This is used to derive an estimate of the prompt contribution of muons, originating from the decay of heavy (mainly charmed) hadrons and unflavored mesons. We will also present measurements of the lateral separation distributions of TeV muons between 150 m and 450 m for several initial cosmic ray energies between 1 PeV and 16 PeV. Finally, the angular distribution of atmospheric muons in IceCube will be discussed.",

The two most famous reconstruction algorithms are Point of Closest Approach (PoCA) and Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM). PoCA is fast but purely geometrical and as a result of this, it gives a lot of false positives, i.e. sometimes the PoCA point lies outside the target object and hence it forms an envelope of false-positive which results in a smeared image. On the other hand, MLEM is an iterative algorithm and is much more computation-intensive. In this work a new and innovative method is proposed which is based on the concept of voxelization to handle the known problem of false positives of the PoCA algorithm, and hence provide a clear reconstructed image. These algorithms remove the false positives PoCA points from the 3D point cloud and will give useful information in terms of regions or voxels within a voxelized volume ‘V’ to do a clear image reconstruction. The advantages of the proposed algorithm to the existing algorithms are also discussed. The status of the experimental setup of the proposed facility using Resistive Plate Chamber(RPC) with spatial resolution of ∼ 1cm as muon detector, is also discussed. The preliminary data from the current experimental setup, showing detector performance and cosmic muon tracks are also shown. Since the experimental setup is not fully ready, the effectiveness of the developed algorithms and the results are evaluated using the data from the Geant4 simulation of the muon tomography setup.",

Due to its diverse range of applications and the use of natural radiation, muography is being applied across many fields such as geology, archaeology, civil engineering, nuclear reactor monitoring, nuclear waste characterization, underground surveys, etc. Muons can be detected using various detector technologies, among which, resistive plate chambers (RPC) are a very cost effective choice. RPCs are planar detectors which use ionization in a thin gas gap to detect cosmic muons, already used since years in major particle accelerator experiments. We have developed a muon telescope (or “muoscope”) composed of small scale RPCs. The design goal for our muoscope is to be portable and autonomous, in order to take data in places that are not easily accessible. The whole setup is light and compact, such to be easily packed in a car trunk. Individual RPCs are hosted in gas-tight aluminium cases. There is no need for gas bottles, once the chambers are filled. The muoscope can be controlled from a reasonable distance using wireless connection. In this paper we summarize the guiding principles of our project and present some recent developments and future prospects, including a long-term stability study of the resistivity of the semiconductive coating obtained with serigraphy.",

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a multi-component detector at the South Pole. Besides study- ing high-energy neutrinos, it is capable of measuring high-energy cosmic rays from PeV to EeV. This energy region is thought to cover the transition from galactic to extragalactic sources of cosmic rays. The observatory consists of the deep in-ice IceCube array, which measures the high-energy (≥ 500 GeV) muonic component, and the IceTop surface array, which is sensitive to the electromagnetic and low-energy muonic part of an air shower. The primary energy and the mass composition can be measured simultaneously by applying statistical methods including modern machine-learning techniques to reconstruct cosmic ray air showers. In this contri- bution, we will discuss recent improvements to the reconstruction techniques, the mass composition sensitivity, and an outlook on future improved measurements with the full surface scintillator/radio array to mitigate snow accumulation and measure the air shower maximum Xmax using imaging air-Cherenkov telescopes IceAct.",

This task is dauntingly re- source hungry, especially when space-charge effects become important, which often coincides with important regimes of operation of these devices. By mod- ifying the electric field inside the RPC dynamically, the space charge plays a crucial role in determining the response of the detector. In this work, a numerical model has been proposed to calculate the dynamic space-charge field inside an RPC and the same has been implemented in the Garfield++ framework. By modeling space charge as large number of line charges and using the multithreading technique OpenMP to calculate electric field, drift line, electron gain, and space-charge field, it has been possible to maintain time consumption within reasonable limits. For this purpose, a new class, pAvalancheMC has been introduced in Garfield++. The calculations have been successfully verified with those from existing solvers and an example is provided to show the performance of pAvalancheMC. Moreover, the details",

Blanco; P. Fonte; L. Lopes; M. Pimenta;,,,,2026-01-13,"The phase-out of hydro-fluorocarbons, due to their high Global Warming Power, affecting the main gas used in Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs), tetrafluoroethane C2 H2 F4 , has increased pressure on existing systems and imposes strong restrictions on its use in new systems. This has motivated the beginning of a new line of R&D on sealed RPCs, RPCs that do not require a continuous gas flow for their operation and dispense the use of very complex and expensive re-circulation and/or recycling gas systems. At the moment it is not clear whether this solution can cover all fields of application normally allocated to RPCs, but it seems that it could be considered as a valid option for low flux triggering/tracking of particles, e.g. in cosmic ray or rare event experiments. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of a small telescope for atmospheric muon tracking consisting of four 300 x 300 mm2 sealed RPCs with gas gap widths of 1 mm, 1.5 mm and 2 mm. The results suggest that it is possible to operate this type of detectors for extended periods of time (more than five months) with its main characteristics mainly: efficiency, average charge and streamer probability, without apparent degradation and similar to a RPC operated in continuous gas flow.",

The conventional method to improve their character- istics, such as light output and timing properties, consists of improving in material composition and doping, etc., which are intrinsic to the material. On the contrary, we review recent advancements in cutting-edge approaches to shape scintillator characteristics via photonic and metamaterial engineering, which are extrinsic and introduce controlled inhomogeneity in the scintillator’s surface or volume. The methods to be discussed include improved light out-coupling using photonic crystal (PhC) coating, dielectric architecture modification producing the Purcell effect, and meta-materials engineering based on energy sharing. These approaches help to break traditional bulk scintillators’ limitations, e.g., to deal with poor light extraction efficiency from the material due to a typically large refractive index mismatch or improve timing performance compared to bulk materials. In the Outlook section, modern physical phenomena are discussed and suggested as the basis for the next generations of scintillation-based detectors and technology, followed by a brief discussion on cost-effective fabrication techniques that could be scalable.",

Despite signiﬁcant progress in CR research over the past century, their origin and the astro- physical processes responsible for accelerating them to such high energies have yet to be fully understood. A comprehensive understanding requires precise measurement of their energy spectrum and mass compo- sition. This article reviews the CR energy spectrum and mass composition measurements above 100 GeV. The CR energy spectrum is generally described by a power law, with notable spectral features commonly referred to as the knee, ankle, and ﬂux suppression. Direct experiments oﬀer high-precision measurements in the GeV–TeV energy range and have revealed spectral hardening around a few hundred GeV and soft- ening near several tens of TeV in the proton and helium spectra. At energies above hundreds of TeV, CRs are observed by indirect experiments using extensive air showers (EASs). Indirect measurements have also observed further spectral features, such as the hardening in light primaries near hundreds of TeV, the second knee, and the instep. This article highlights the GRAPES-3 experiment, in Ooty, India, focusing on the methodology of using muon multiplicity to estimate mass composition and the observation of spectral hardening at 166 TeV in the CR proton spectrum. These observed spectral features provide important con- straints for reﬁning theoretical models of CR origin, acceleration, and propagation. Indirect measurements, particularly of mass composition, are subject to large systematic uncertainties because the interpretation of observables relies on simulations based on hadronic interaction models. This article brieﬂy discusses signiﬁcant discrepancies in mass composition results arising from the limited theoretical understanding of these models, emphasizing the need for improved hadronic interaction modeling.",

MST measures the magnitude of muon scattering angles inside an object, which depends not only on the material properties but also on the muon momentum. Due to the difficulty of simultaneous measurement of momentum, it was neglected and taken as a constant in multiple MST reconstruction algorithms. Recently, an experimental measurement scheme has emerged that is feasible in engineering, but it requires many layers of detectors to approach the true momentum. From this, we proposed both an algorithm to incorporating momentum into MST, and a scheme to determine the thresholds of Cherenkov detectors. This novel scheme, termed the ""equi- percentage scheme"", sets momentum thresholds for Cherenkov detector layers based on cosmic muon momentum distribution. Results showed our approach delivers noticeable enhancement in reconstructed image quality even with only two detector layers, reaching near-saturation performance with four layers. This study proves that momentum measurement significantly enhances short-duration MST, and that substantial improvement can be achieved with relatively coarse momentum measurement using 2-4 layers of Cherenkov detectors.",

In this work, we present an investigation of the low-threshold rate (scaler) time series recorded in 16 yr of operation by the Pierre Auger Observatory surface detectors in Malargüe, Argentina. Through an advanced spectral analysis, we detected highly statistically significant variations in the time series with periods ranging from the decadal to the daily scale. We investigate their origin, revealing a direct connection with solar variability. Thanks to their intrinsic very low noise level, the Auger scalers allow a thorough and detailed investigation of the galactic cosmic-ray flux variations in the heliosphere at different timescales and can, therefore, be considered a new proxy of solar variability.

Zyla,,,,2026-01-13,"Ground-based gamma-ray astronomy is now firmly established as a key observational approach to address critical topics at the frontiers of astroparticle physics and high-energy astrophysics. Whilst the field of TeV astronomy was once dominated by arrays of atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, ground-level particle detection has now been demonstrated to be an equally viable and strongly complementary approach. Ground-level particle detection provides continuous monitoring of the overhead sky, critical for the mapping of extended structures and capturing transient phenomena. As demonstrated by HAWC and LHAASO, the technique provides the best available sensitivity above a few tens of TeV, and for the first time access to the PeV energy range. Despite the success of this approach, there is so far no major ground-level particle-based observatory with access to the Southern sky. H.E.S.S., located in Namibia, is the only major gamma-ray instrument in the Southern Hemisphere, and has shown the extraordinary richness of the inner galaxy in the TeV band, but is limited both in terms of field of view and energy reach. SWGO, the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory, is an international effort to construct the first wide-field instrument in the south with deep sensitivity from 100s of GeV into the PeV domain. The project is now close to the end of its development phase and planning for construction of the array in Chile has begun. Here we describe the baseline design, expected sensitivity and resolution, and describe in detail the main scientific topics that will be addressed by this new facility and its initial phase SWGO-A. We show that SWGO will have a transformational impact on a wide range of topics from cosmic-ray acceleration and transport to the nature of dark matter. SWGO represents a key piece of infrastructure for multi-messenger astronomy in the next decade, with strong scientific synergies with the nearby CTA Observatory.",

MOSTAFAVI ALHOSSEINI,,,,2026-01-13,". Radio detection of cosmic rays investigates the electromagnetic component of extensive air show- ers. It is possible to obtain the most critical properties of a cosmic ray, including the depth of shower maximum, energy, and type of primary particle, from radio measurements. Semnan University Radio Array is a new experi- ment that strives to detect radio emissions from extensive air showers induced by ultra-high energy cosmic rays. To fully harness the potential of the radio detection method in a self-trigger setup, it is essential to have artificial digital and analog filters to eliminate major unwanted emissions, analog-to-digital converters with appropriate specifications for accurate signal reconstruction, and data processing units capable of implementing software- based analysis alongside advanced digital signal processing techniques. This paper describes the design and implementation of a self-triggering approach in SURA-4 as the first phase of the SURA experiment to preserve cosmic ray candidates while removing unwanted emissions by utilizing the capabilities of analog and digital elements and incorporating a custom software framework for radio signal analyses. The ultimate validation of this approach for reliably distinguishing cosmic rays from anthropogenic radio frequency interferences will be pursued in future experiment phases, including cross-verification with three particle detectors.",

On 2024 May 10, after the arrival of the ICME shock at 17:04 UT, a Forbush Decrease (FD) was seen in various Neutron Monitor (NM) stations located worldwide. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of neutron data from 28 NM stations and gamma-ray data obtained from the NaI(Tl) detector at Maitri, Antarctica. The present paper reports for the first time about an ICME shock-sheath related enhancement of ∼3%–5% magnitude in the neutron flux at stations with geomagnetic rigidity between 4 and 7 GV, located at higher altitudes (�1000 m). For these stations, the high-rigidity ends of the asymptotic trajectories are confined to the midnight to the postmidnight region. It appears that the increase may be associated with magnetospheric particle precipitation triggered by the passage of the ICME shock-sheath. The variation of FD amplitude with rigidity shows a decreasing trend in general, with a minimum amplitude at 5–7 GV, which we attribute to the location of field-aligned currents (FACs). The FD amplitude is found to have the effects of storm-time westward ring current, FACs, and magnetospheric dynamics, in addition to the ICME parameters. During the recovery phase of FD, enhancement is observed between 01:50 and 03:00 UT on 2024 May 11, which coincided with Ground Level Enhancement (GLE#74). The GLE#74 was coeval with the strong SYM-H index and the sudden recovery of the FD due to reduced interplanetary magnetic field, which might be responsible for the observed enhancement at high rigidity stations.

Gaunt; Adam Owen,,,,2026-01-13,"FeynCraft is a browser-based game that is designed to teach players the particle interactions of the Standard Model of particle physics, and how to link these interactions together to produce valid Feynman diagrams. It is primarily targeted at undergraduates and lecturers in introductory courses in particle physics, but we anticipate that it should also be useful for school pupils and teachers studying the basics of particle physics, and perhaps also current researchers. Users may draw particle lines and link them together to form vertices and complete diagrams, and FeynCraft determines invalid vertices using a sequence of simple rules, showing users which vertices are invalid and why. Diagrams may be drawn that involve both fundamental Standard Model particles and hadrons (where hadrons are represented by their constituent quark content). Users can also be presented with a process for which they must draw valid Feynman diagrams – FeynCraft is able to generate such ‘problems’ at random, but there is also the facility to create, share, import and solve curated sets of problems. Alternatively, one is able to specify the process, and ask FeynCraft itself to generate the Feynman diagrams. Finally, we include several overlay options that give more information on a Feynman diagram (e.g. QCD colour flow, interaction strengths), and the option to export a drawn diagram as LATEX code.",

Its task number will be undoubtedly extended in future. We proposed to use existing WCDA (Water Cherenkov Detector Array being a part of LHAASO) as a pair-meter to measure atmospheric muon energy spectrum. This work confirms that WCDA without any reconstruction can serve as an optimal pair-meter to study near- horizontal atmospheric muons with energy beyond ~ 10 TeV. In this article we study response of the WCDA detector to Cherenkov light produced by high energy muons and its accompanying, taking into account the cells configuration, possible crosstalk between cells, and photomultiplier (PMT) characteristics.",
